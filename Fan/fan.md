## What is a fan
 
If you have made it through the internet all the way to this calculator, I don't think we have to tell you that a fan is a rotating <portal cid=753>circle</portal> segmented into blades in such a way that when it rotates it moves air from one side of the circle to the other. So, instead, we will talk about why are fans useful, what kind of fans there are and where could we expect to find each type. Starting from the beginning we find mostly the cooling effect that a fan produces, due to the air circulation.

This is very well known for those of you that live in warm climates, where having a fan blasting air at your face can make you feel colder, as if the temperature had actually dropped. The temperature does indeed not drop, but only the way you perceive it. This effect is similar to that of the <portal cid=XXX>wind chill</portal> and has to do with things like <portal cid=XXX>cooling laws</portal>, <portal cid=XXX>thermal conductivity</portal>, <portal cid=XXX>heat loss</portal> and <portal cid=XXX>specific heat</portal> amongst other factors.

Because fans move air and help it circulate, they also help in getting a uniform temperature within a confined space, like a room. And here is where we need to talk about different kinds of fans for each use of a fan. From the personal USB fan that you can attach to your computer, to the ceiling fans that you can find in big room, or even those "_big ass_" fans in ventilation systems designed to cool and move air for entire buildings... Fans can take many sizes and also forms.

Regarding what types of fans we expect to find in what places, we should start with the obvious: most fans exist in hot places and closed spaces. For ventilation purposes fans tend to be ugly big or powerful and optimized for performance rather than silence; this is because they are generally hidden and barely ever serve any aesthetic purpose. On the other hand ceiling fans tend to be quiet and pretty since, apart from the obvious function of moving air, they should not disturb people having conversations under it, and should (at the very least) not detract from the appearance of the room they are located in.

We also have bathroom fans, which could fall into the ventilation category since bathroom fans are barely ever meant to be seen. More importantly, thought, are outdoor fans and standing fans like the ones you would pull out on a hot summer day in hope for some refreshing breeze. These fans are somewhere between the first two categories we discussed above. They tend to strike a balance between mass flow rate (don't fret, we will explain later what that is and what does CFM stand for) and noise, and they also come in a wide variety of designs, sizes and prices. Here we could include computer fans easily, both the ones used to cool it and the USB ones that you cool you.

The last type of fans that you can find are the sports fans, but those are not very efficient at moving air and make a lot of noise. Hereafter we shall not discuss said type of fans. Also, we would like to apologise for such an easy and cheap joke.
