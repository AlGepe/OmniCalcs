Welcome to the fan calculator made for fans of fans who want to have tons of fun!
## What is a fan
 
If you have made it through the internet all the way to this calculator, I don't think we have to tell you that a fan is a rotating <portal cid=753>circle</portal> segmented into blades in such a way that when it rotates it moves air from one side of the circle to the other. So, instead, we will talk about why are fans useful, what kind of fans there are and where could we expect to find each type. Starting from the beginning we find mostly the cooling effect that a fan produces, due to the air circulation.

This is very well known for those of you that live in warm climates, where having a fan blasting air at your face can make you feel colder, as if the temperature had actually dropped. The temperature does indeed not drop, but only the way you perceive it. This effect is similar to that of the <portal cid=XXX>wind chill</portal> and has to do with things like <portal cid=XXX>cooling laws</portal>, <portal cid=XXX>thermal conductivity</portal>, <portal cid=XXX>heat loss</portal> and <portal cid=XXX>specific heat</portal> amongst other factors.

Because fans move air and help it circulate, they also help in getting a uniform temperature within a confined space, like a room. And here is where we need to talk about different kinds of fans for each use of a fan. From the personal USB fan that you can attach to your computer, to the ceiling fans that you can find in big room, or even those "_big ass_" fans in ventilation systems designed to cool and move air for entire buildings... Fans can take many sizes and also forms.

Regarding what types of fans we expect to find in what places, we should start with the obvious: most fans exist in hot places and closed spaces. For ventilation purposes fans tend to be ugly big or powerful and optimized for performance rather than silence; this is because they are generally hidden and barely ever serve any aesthetic purpose. On the other hand ceiling fans tend to be quiet and pretty since, apart from the obvious function of moving air, they should not disturb people having conversations under it, and should (at the very least) not detract from the appearance of the room they are located in.

We also have bathroom fans, which could fall into the ventilation category since bathroom fans are barely ever meant to be seen. More importantly, thought, are outdoor fans and standing fans like the ones you would pull out on a hot summer day in hope for some refreshing breeze. These fans are somewhere between the first two categories we discussed above. They tend to strike a balance between mass flow rate (don't fret, we will explain later what that is and what does CFM stand for) and noise, and they also come in a wide variety of designs, sizes and prices. Here we could include computer fans easily, both the ones used to cool it and the USB or battery powered fans that cool you.

The last type of fans that you can find are the sports fans, but those are not very efficient at moving air and make a lot of noise. Hereafter we shall not discuss said type of fans. Also, we would like to apologise for such an easy and cheap joke.  

## Specifications of a fan

Now that we have talked about the types of fans and their places, it's time to talk about the objective things that make one fan different from another. First and more importantly is size; which can be parametrized by the diameter of the <portal cid=XXX>circumference</portal> the fan covers. Another difference between fans is the <portal cid=XXX>speed</portal> at which they spin, generally expressed in RPM or Revolutions Per Minute, which is pretty much self-explanatory. The other factor that differentiates fans is the design of the blades, which change some of the more subtle characteristics of the performance. For example, very well known to computer cooling enthusiasts, there are computer cooling fans that are optimised for <portal cid=XXX>air pressure</portal>, whilst others are optimised for airflow.

This distinction between air flow or <portal cid=XXX>pressure optimisation</portal> of a fan is a fairly important one in some aspects, but rarely comes out the context of fan-nerdom or computer cooling fans. In the case of computer cooling, the idea is that an airflow based fan will be better for moving big amounts of air in an unrestricted scenario, i.e.: when there's nothing close to the fan obstructing the air flowing. On the other hand, pressure optimised fans are designed for situations in which there is an object blocking the air flow like a radiation, and hence higher pressure is required to avoid the flow of air being completely obstructed but such object.

The way pressure is mentioned and used in the fan world is fairly standard and does not call for the use of exotic units. However, when we are talking about airflow, being a more complex quantity than pressure, there are certain remarks and special units to be used. In particular, in the fan world, the term used is "mass flow rate" and the units used are generally CFM. So let's take a closer look at these concepts before we can start using the calculator.

## Mass flow rate and what does CFM mean

The term "mass flow rate" is fairly explanatory in itself, since it refers to the amount of material that passes through the fan per unit time. One could say that the mass flow rate equation, and mathematical definition is: `dm/dt` which is the derivative of the mass with respect to time. If we talk about what is CFM, that is unit of measurement for the flow rate. CFM stands for **_Cubic Feet per Minute_** which might sound a bit strange since <portal cid=XXX>cubic feet</portal> is a unit of volume and not mass or weight.

However, if we use the density of whatever substance is going through the fan, we can convert from volume to mass in a simple step. This requires that you know one more data about the medium in which the fan will operate. That's why SCFM exist; SCFM stands for "Standard CFM" and it's a measurement of CFM for a gas of fixed density. The premise is that the gas is in what chemists call "Standard conditions" which are a set of temperature and pressure that are representative of the common, everyday values.

So generally when people ask "What does CFM mean?" the are generally asking about SCFM, since that's the specification that fan manufacturers quote. In any case, we can always say that CFM stands for the imperial units used to measure flow rate, either in volume or in mass flow rate by using the standard conditions.

## Using the fan calculator

This fan calculator that we have made for fans of fans can help you calculate the CFM value of a given fan if you know the pressure it creates and the power it uses. We have not mentioned specifically the power used by a fan as an specification, but it is related to the dimensions and rotational speed of the fan. The power consumption is generally stated among the electrical requirements, if you take the voltage and current at which operate you can calculate the power requirements of the fan. _**Hint**: use our you <portal cid=XXX>electrical power calculator</portal> if you need help_

Back to our calculator, it has 3 different fields that you can fill; but if you're able to fill the three of them, you don't really need this calculator, so you? We created this calculator for calculating CFM of a fan, but the good thing about this calculator is that you can fill any two fields and it would automatically calculate the missing one. The calculator should be intuitive enough for anyone to use without reading the "instructions" but let's explore a typical use case that you might actually go through.

Let's say you just got a new fan and you want to know the CFM of your new purchase, but the manufacturer does not give the specification in the box. So this are the steps you would take to find out the CFM:

1) Look for the pressure specification given by the manufacturer
1) If you can find the power specification for the fan, skip the next two stops
1) Find the voltage and amperage at which the fan operates
1) Use our power calculator to find the power consumption of the fan
1) Take this value and put it in the calculator
1) The CFM should appear calculated on the third field

This is one of many uses we can thing of for this calculator, not the only one. As a matter of fact most computer cooling fans have CFM listed in the specification, but very few list the pressure. This calculator would come very handy for those that want to compute the pressure created by their fans. It would be as easy to do as simple following the instructions above but changing pressure for CFM and vice versa.
