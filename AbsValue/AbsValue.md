## What is absolute value

Let's start from the beginning, shall we? The term absolute value might have different meaning depending in the context, but here, in the math world, it is very clearly defined. The absolute value of any number is simply the value of the number, forgetting about the sign. This definition is not the most technical one, but it's sure to confuse no one. 

For those who want the utmost precision when it comes to their mathematical definitions, we paraphrase Wikipedia's very good definition:

Now that you know what it is, we can talk about how to write it and operate with is in mathematical terms. The **mathematical symbol for absolute value is** `|x|` where `x` would denote whatever number we want the absolute value of. For example the absolute value of 3 is written `|3|` and the absolute value of -5.3 would be written `|-5.3|`. 

To **calculate the absolute value of a number** you simply "take off the sign" from the number. One can also think about it as "making the number inside positive". If you want to sound more fancy you can always make up your way to explain what you do like say, for example "You compute the distance between the number you're interested in and the value 0 (zero)"

It is important to know that the absolute value operation it's not limit to just numbers, it can be applied to expressions and equations like this :`|-3x+3|` where `x` would be an unknown value.

We will explain in detail how to calculate the absolute value of equations, or the absolute value of a graph/function. For now, let's go step by step.
