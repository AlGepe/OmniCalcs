## What is "absolute value": definition

Let's start from the beginning, shall we? The term absolute value might have different meaning depending in the context, but here, in the math world, it is very clearly defined. The absolute value of any number is simply the value of the number, forgetting about the sign. This definition is not the most technical one, but it's sure to confuse no one. 

For those who want the utmost precision when it comes to their mathematical definitions, we paraphrase Wikipedia's very good definition:

[INSERT WIKI DEF}

Now that you know what it is, we can talk about how to write it and operate with is in mathematical terms. The **mathematical symbol for absolute value is** `|x|` where `x` would denote whatever number we want the absolute value of. For example the absolute value of 3 is written `|3|` and the absolute value of -5.3 would be written `|-5.3|`. 

To **calculate the absolute value of a number** you simply "take off the sign" from the number. One can also think about it as "making the number inside positive". If you want to sound more fancy you can always make up your way to explain what you do like say, for example "You compute the distance between the number you're interested in and the value 0 (zero)"

It is important to know that the absolute value operation it's not limit to just numbers, it can be applied to expressions and equations like this :`|-3x+3|` where `x` would be an unknown value.

We will explain in detail how to calculate the absolute value of equations, or the absolute value of a graph/function. For now, let's go step by step.

## Is absolute value useful?

Heck yeah it is! /endofsection

Oh, I guess you want some reasons why it is, right? Well, let's start from the easiest: any situation in which we care about differences, and only differences. For example, when we are talking about the distance between two things. The obvious one is the distance between two points of the total travelled distances by an object (typical physics problem). 

For example if a car starts at the point `x=5` and moves to `x=2`, what is the distance it has travelled? You can simply say it's `5-2=3` but that is technically incorrect, since the distance is actually the absolute value of the difference between the starting finish and the starting point. In this case would be `|2-5| = 5-2 = 3` which give us the same result as before but much more technical prowess to show off ;)

Then we also have the absolute value as a way of abbreviating our writing. For example, if we want a function that gives only positive numbers, we could write a set of 'if...else' conditions but then it would get too long. Absolute value to the rescue: we can simply wrap our function inside the absolute value signs and that would mean we always have positive values. This means that `|f(x)|` is always positive no matter the value of `f(x)`.

## Absolute value functions and absolute value graphs

And this usefulness leads directly into absolute value graphs and absolute value inside functions. Both simple things in theory, but both tricky at the beginning.
