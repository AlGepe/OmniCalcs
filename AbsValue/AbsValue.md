## What is "absolute value": definition

Let's start from the beginning, shall we? The term absolute value might have different meaning depending in the context, but here, in the math world, it is very clearly defined. The absolute value of any number is simply the value of the number, forgetting about the sign. This definition is not the most technical one, but it's sure to confuse no one. 

For those who want the utmost precision when it comes to their mathematical definitions, we paraphrase Wikipedia's very good definition:

[INSERT WIKI DEF}

Now that you know what it is, we can talk about how to write it and operate with is in mathematical terms. The **mathematical symbol for absolute value is** `|x|` where `x` would denote whatever number we want the absolute value of. For example the absolute value of 3 is written `|3|` and the absolute value of -5.3 would be written `|-5.3|`. 

To **calculate the absolute value of a number** you simply "take off the sign" from the number. One can also think about it as "making the number inside positive". If you want to sound more fancy you can always make up your way to explain what you do like say, for example "You compute the distance between the number you're interested in and the value 0 (zero)"

It is important to know that the absolute value operation it's not limit to just numbers, it can be applied to expressions and equations like this :`|-3x+3|` where `x` would be an unknown value.

We will explain in detail how to calculate the absolute value of equations, or the absolute value of a graph/function. For now, let's go step by step.

## Is absolute value useful?

Heck yeah it is! /endofsection

Oh, I guess you want some reasons why it is, right? Well, let's start from the easiest: any situation in which we care about differences, and only differences. For example, when we are talking about the distance between two things. The obvious one is the distance between two points of the total travelled distances by an object (typical physics problem). 

For example if a car starts at the point `x=5` and moves to `x=2`, what is the distance it has travelled? You can simply say it's `5-2=3` but that is technically incorrect, since the distance is actually the absolute value of the difference between the starting finish and the starting point. In this case would be `|2-5| = 5-2 = 3` which give us the same result as before but much more technical prowess to show off ;)

Then we also have the absolute value as a way of abbreviating our writing. For example, if we want a function that gives only positive numbers, we could write a set of 'if...else' conditions but then it would get too long. Absolute value to the rescue: we can simply wrap our function inside the absolute value signs and that would mean we always have positive values. This means that `|f(x)|` is always positive no matter the value of `f(x)`.

## Absolute value functions and absolute value graphs

And this usefulness leads directly into absolute value graphs and absolute value inside functions. Both simple things in theory, but both tricky at the beginning. Let's start with the most basic absolute value function: `f(x) = |x|`. Before we think about its shape, we already know that this absolute value function can only have values above the x-axis, that is `f(x)` only has positive values. 

Digging a bit deeper we can start with the positive part `x>0`, in this case `f(x) = x` so we get a straight line at exactly 45ยบ which bisects the first quadrant of the Cartesian axis. The part for negative x, `x<0` can be re-written as `f(x) = -x` and give a symmetrical line to the positive x part with the y-axis acting as the axis of symmetry. This part bisects the second quadrant and forms an angle of 135ยบ with the x-axis. For completeness sake we should add that `f(0) = |0| = 0` completing the symmetry.

Things get a bit more complicated when we get more complicated expression inside the absolute value. As long as the absolute value is surrounding the whole expressions, we can use a small trick. If we look back at `f(x) = |x|` as a modification on `f(x)=x` we can see that the difference is that the negative part of `f(x)=x` has been lifted up to have positive values. More precisely, what we've done is flip it over around the x-axis, to a mirror image of the original part. 

This same trick can be used for any function wrapped in absolute value. Just draw the function ignoring the absolute value, and then flip over whatever part is below `y=0`. The result is a perfect representation of the absolute value graph without any headaches. Take a look at the examples we've chosen in the pictures of this sections.

As a side note for those interested, any absolute value graph in which you need to use this trick, it would be as continuous as the original one, but it will have a sharp, non differentiable, point wherever there values changed from positive to negative. For example, in the function `f(x)=|x|` we get a sharp point at `f(0) = 0`.

For more complicated expression where the absolute value function is inside the expression like in `f(x) = 2x+3 / |x|` this get complicated, and require more thorough mathematical analysis. It is not impossible to do, and it's more about labour than complexity. However that goes beyond the scope of this calculator, so we will stop here and swiftly move to absolute value equations and inequalities.
