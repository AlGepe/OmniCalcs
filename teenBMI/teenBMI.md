## What is bmi and does it matter for teens?

Many of you probably know already what bmi is, but for those who don't and to have a complete picture of it, let's talk briefly about what it is. bmi stands for Body Mass Index and it is a measurement of the body <portal cid=207>weight</portal> in relation to the <portal cid=733>height</portal> of a person. The most widely used units are metric ones (that is meters for <portal cid=208>length</portal>/height and kilograms for weight), even in imperial countries like the USA.

Obtaining your bmi is very simple and can be done by simply diving your weight by your height squared, as shown in the bmi formula:

`bmi = weight/height²`

As you can see it is no rocket science to calculate the bmi, but for those lazy amongst us (trust us, you're not alone) we have made this simple bmi calculator for teens. The calculator is designed to work best when calculating bmi for teenagers, as it will give you extra information for this population group. If you desire to calculate the bmi of a person not in this group we have different bmi calculators designed for all population groups.

## Why a bmi calculator for teens

In fact, at Omni we have created a total of 5 bmi calculators that include a general bmi calculator (jack of all trades, master of none) as well as specific bmi calculators for men, women, kids and teens. Feel free to use the one that better suit your needs by following the links below:

* General <portal cid=81>BMI calculator</portal>
* <portal cid=221> BMI calculator for men</portal>
* <portal cid=1452>BMI calculator for women</portal>
* <portal cid=1463>BMI calculator for kids</portal> (boys and girls up to 10 years old)
* BMI calculator for teens (_this one_)

If you are feeling curious we encourage you to check out all of the calculators since there is interesting information not only about bmi, but about its relation to health and how to properly use this value to your advantage.

Some of you might be wondering why we made so many calculators if the formula for the bmi is the same no matter the person. The answer is very simple: statistics and percentiles. We will get into more detail about this topics in a later section but for now we can say that different populations have different acceptable values for bmi; for example, the value for a healthy bmi for teens is not the same as for a 2 year old kid. Having multiple calculators allows you to get more precise information about the population group you're interested in without haveing to search between thousands of irrelevant facts for you.

## BMI, statistics and percentiles

It is useless to talk about bmi without a point of reference or comparison. In fact, bmi was always designed to be a statistical comparison tool to asses a person's body state. We have talked in great detail about the flaws of a statistical tool for assesing the health of one individual, but as long as we set some constrains, bmi can still be useful. 

First thing to know is that bmi is meant as a measurement for sedentary people, this means that atheletes and very active people might have "unhealthy" bmi values despite being totally helathy. The second thing to note is that bmi doesn't take into account body types and <portal cid=566> body shapes</portal>, so if you have an uncommon or extreme body type, your bmi might not be a good indicator of your health.

These shortcomings of bmi are due to its statistical nature. bmi ranges and bmi charts are constructed using data of people's actual body mass index and this can skew the results. This is not to say that bmi is useless since most of the population is 'averagely healthy' but just that it needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. For easy comparison bmi is typically divided into percentiles or percentile groups.

The percentile is the position you occupy in the bmi range in comparison with the rest of your population. So if your bmi lays on the 30th percentile that means that your bmi is higher than 30% of the population. Since making a distinction between 72nd and 73rd percentile is effectively irrelevant, percentiles are typically group according to the bmi categories the represent..

For example, in this calculator, we follow the WHO (World Health Organization) ruling and group the percentiles of bmi for teens in 10 groups: lower than 5th, 5th-10th, 10th-25th, 25th-50th, 50th-75th, 75th-85th, 85th-90th, 90-95th, higher than 95th. For adult population each of these groups represents a different bmi category. However, for teens and kids that are still developing there are only 4 categories recognised by the WHO: Underweight (lower than 5th), Normal/Healthy (5th-85th), Overweight (85th-95th) and Obese (higher than 95th).

## BMI prime and healthy bmi for teens

There is one more item in the bmi calculator for teens that we haven't mentioned and it is the bmi prime. This quantity, derived from bmi, is a measurement of how close your bmi is from the "healthy bmi for adults". The standard value set for healthy bmi in adults is a bmi of 25kg/m² and it's very useful for men and women. Its validity is at best questionable for teens and kids, but we have decided to keep it here, for comparison between calculators and also for consistency.

To obtain the value of your bmi prime, all you need to do is to divide your actual bmi by 25, and you will obtain a number hopefully close to 1. The closer you get to 1, the healthier your bmi is set to be. It is important, however, to remember that since we're dealing with smaller numbers, the variation between worryingly unhealthy and 'perfect' is much smaller than with the regular bmi.

We have mentioned that the bmi prime is pretty much irrelevant for most teens and kids; that is because there is a great variation between different ages in terms of what is a healthy bmi. A healthy bmi for teens varies between 14 and about 25 depending on the age and sex. In the next section we will see why is this.

## BMI chart for teens and its relevance

When it comes to determining what is a healthy bmi for teens, bmi charts rule, quite literally. What we mean by that is that bmi charts for teens (and kids) are actually the medical way to determine whether a teenager has a healthy body mass index or if they are at risk. These charts (shown in this section) are different for boys and girls and present a visualization of the percentiles we mentioned in the previous section. 

When looking at the charts, you can quickly find what percentile you belong to and, hence, how (un)healthy your bmi is. At this early stages of body development there are many factors that influence the <portal cid=292>body composition</portal> and proportions, both of which are things that affect the bmi value. 

If we said that for adults there are many variables ignored by bmi, for teens and kids it's even worse. One way to deal with that is to separate the acceptable bmi values by age and gender and just compare a given teenager with the rest of teenagers in his or her age. This is by no means perfect, but together with the broad margins for healthy bmi for teens established by the WHO, makes it a fairly robust diagnostics system.

We need, as always, to not loose sight of the bigger picture and for that we have dedicated an entire section. For now let's just take a look at the bmi charts for teens and, after that, learn how to use the bmi calculator for teens, and what to do with its results; after all that's what you came here for_, ain't it?_

## How to use the bmi calculator for teens

Using our bmi calculator for teens is very simple. All you really need to do is to input your height and weight to get your bmi and bmi prime values. However, if you also input your age and sex, you will get much more information. More specifically, the calculator will automatically tell you all this information:

* Your bmi
* Your bmi prime
* Your percentile according to your age and sex
* Your bmi category according to the WHO

Now you have all the data you possibly came here to find, but numbers are numbers and they are useless unless you know how to interpret them. When have done our best to explain some of the terms and values we provide in our calculator, but we haven't really gone in-depth about the connection between bmi and health. So let's do it in the next section.

## A word of caution regarding bmi for teens and health

After talking about bmi and its ideal values as well as categories, we need to take a step back and speak why we talk about bmi in the first place. In a world where we have places suffering an obesity epidemic while at the same time millions of people die of malnutrition, assessing our body's health states is very important. Ideally, you would go to your doctor periodically and get full body exams including blood tests and body composition tests.

However, that is impractical and even impossible for some people, so the WHO decided to create a simple tool that would serve as a quick and easy indicator of your body state, at least regarding nutrition. There are so many factors that influence the health of a human body, that it would be too complicated to include them all.

Even if the WHO would decide to use something like our Omni calculators to estimate the amount of <portal cid=292>body fat</portal>, <portal cid=123>lean body mass</portal> or <portal cid=777>body water</portal> it would still be a very time consuming process and would requite access to the internet, which cannot be taken for granted. So, instead, the WHO decided to settle for a quantity that could be calculated from two easy to measure parameters: height and weight.

Using these two simple values (which pretty much anyone know roughly) we can get a decent estimator of your body's health and whether you should take action to improve it or not. The best way to think about bmi is as a "pre-doctor" test that you can do at any time. If you find yourself in the risk categories (underweight, obese, etc.) you should then consult with an expert to get a more thorough check on your health and get accurate results.

Just remember that everything you read on the internet should be taken with a pinch of salt. The best medical advice and diagnosis comes from doctors that have undergone the proper training and studies. If you want expert opinion on a topic, consult an expert.
