## What is bmi and does it matter for teens?

Many of you probably know already what bmi is, but for those who don't and to have a complete picture of it, let's talk briefly about what it is. bmi stands for Body Mass Index and it is a measurement of the body <portal cid=207>weight</portal> in relation to the <portal cid=733>height</portal> of a person. The most widely used units are metric ones (that is meters for <portal cid=208>length</portal>/height and kilograms for weight), even in imperial countries like the USA.

Obtaining your bmi is very simple and can be done by simply diving your weight by your height squared, as shown in the bmi formula:

`bmi = weight/heightÂ²`

As you can see it is no rocket science to calculate the bmi, but for those lazy amongst us (trust us, you're not alone) we have made this simple bmi calculator for teens. The calculator is designed to work best when calculating bmi for teenagers, as it will give you extra information for this population group. If you desire to calculate the bmi of a person not in this group we have different bmi calculators designed for all population groups.

## Why a bmi calculator for teens

In fact, at Omni we have created a total of 5 bmi calculators that include a general bmi calculator (jack of all trades, master of none) as well as specific bmi calculators for men, women, kids and teens. Feel free to use the one that better suit your needs by following the links below:

*) General <portal cid=81>BMI calculator</portal>
*) <portal cid=221> BMI calculator for men</portal>
*) <portal cid=1452>BMI calculator for women</portal>
*) <portal cid=1463>BMI calculator for kids</portal> (boys and girls up to 10 years old)
*) BMI calculator for teens (_this one_)

If you are feeling curious we encourage you to check out all of the calculators since there is interesting information not only about bmi, but about its relation to health and how to properly use this value to your advantage.

Some of you might be wondering why we made so many calculators if the formula for the bmi is the same no matter the person. The answer is very simple: statistics and percentiles. We will get into more detail about this topics in a later section but for now we can say that different populations have different acceptable values for bmi; for example, the value for a healthy bmi for teens is not the same as for a 2 year old kid. Having multiple calculators allows you to get more precise information about the population group you're interested in without haveing to search between thousands of irrelevant facts for you.

## BMI, statistics and percentiles

It is useless to talk about bmi without a point of reference or comparison. In fact, bmi was always designed to be a statistical comparison tool to asses a person's body state. We have talked in great detail about the flaws of a statistical tool for assesing the health of one individual, but as long as we set some constrains, bmi can still be useful. 

First thing to know is that bmi is meant as a measurement for sedentary people, this means that atheletes and very active people might have "unhealthy" bmi values despite being totally helathy. The second thing to note is that bmi doesn't take into account body types and <portal cid=566> body shapes</portal>, so if you have an uncommon or extreme body type, your bmi might not be a good indicator of your health.

These shortcomings of bmi are due to its statistical nature. bmi ranges and bmi charts are constructed using data of people's actual body mass index and this can skew the results. This is not to say that bmi is useless since most of the population is 'averagely healthy' but just that it needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. For easy comparison bmi is typically divided into percentiles or percentile groups.

The percentile is the position you occupy in the bmi range in comparison with the rest of your population. So if your bmi lays on the 30th percentile that means that your bmi is higher than 30% of the population. Since making a distinction between 72nd and 73rd percentile is effectively irrelevant, percentiles are typically group according to the bmi categories the represent..

For example, in this calculator, we follow the WHO (World Health Organization) ruling and group the percentiles of bmi for teens in 10 groups: lower than 5th, 5th-10th, 10th-25th, 25th-50th, 50th-75th, 75th-85th, 85th-90th, 90-95th, higher than 95th. For adult population each of these groups represents a different bmi category. However, for teens and kids that are still developing there are only 4 categories recognised by the WHO: Underweight (lower than 5th), Normal/Healthy (5th-85th), Overweight (85th-95th) and Obese (higher than 95th).
