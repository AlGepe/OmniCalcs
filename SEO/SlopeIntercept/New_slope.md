The slope intercept form calculator tells you how to find the equation of a line for any two points that this line passes through. It will help you find the coefficients of slope and y-intercept, as well as the x-intercept, using the slope intercept formulas. Read on to learn what is the slope intercept form of a linear equation.

## What is the slope intercept form

Any line in a flat plane can be described mathematically as a relationship between the vertical (y-axis) and horizontal (x-axis) position of each of those points. This relation can be written as `y = [something with x]`, and the specific form of `[something with x]` will determine what kind of line we have. For example `y = x^2 + x` is a parabola, also called a quadratic function. On the other hand `y = mx + b` (with `m` and `b` representing any number) is the relationship of a straight line.

In this slope intercept form calculator we will focus only on the straight line, but those interested in knowing more about the parabolic function should not worry. We have two special calculators dedicate to such an equation, namely the <portal cid="485">Parabola calculator</portal> and the <portal cid="486">Quadratic formula calculator</portal> in which everything about this type of functions is explained in detail.

Linear equations, or straight line equations, can be recognized by having no terms with exponents on them. (For example, you will find an `x` or a `y`, but never an `x²`.) Each linear equation describes a straight line.

As we have seen before, you can write the equation of any line in the form of `y = mx + b`. This is the so-called slope intercept form, because it gives you two important pieces of information: the slope `m` and the y-intercept `b` of the line. You can use these values for <portal cid="486">linear interpolation</portal> later.

The term `slope` is the inclination, or gradient, of a line. It tells us how much `y` changes for a fixed change in `x`. If it is positive, the values of `y` increase with increasing `x`; if it is negative, `y` decreases with an increasing `x`. You can read more about it in the description of our <portal cid="184">slope calculator</portal>.

`Y-intercept` is the value of `y` at which the line crosses the y-axis. To find it, you have to substitute an x = 0 to the linear equation. We will see later how the y-intercept is an important parameter in linear equations and we will also see the physical meaning of its value in certain real-world examples.

## Slope intercept formula derivation

How to find the slope intercept form of a linear equation, then? We will assume you know two points that the straight line goes through. The first one will have coordinates (x₁, y₁) and the second one (x₂, y₂). Your unknowns are the slope `m` and the y-intercept `b`.

Firstly, substitute the coordinates of the two points into the slope intercept equation:

(1) `y₁ = mx₁ + b`

(2) `y₂ = mx₂ + b`

Then, subtract the first equation from the second:

`y₂ - y₁ = m(x₂ - x₁)`

Finally, divide both sides of the equation by `(x₂ - x₁)` to find the slope:

`m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁)`

Once you have found the slope, you can substitute it into the first or second equation to find the y-intercept:

`y₁ = x₁(y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁) + b`

`b = y₁ - x₁(y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁)`

## How to find the equation of a line

This slope intercept form calculator allows you to find the equation of a line in the slope intercept form, if all you have given are two points that the line goes through. You need to follow the procedure outlined below.

1. Write down the coordinates of the first point. Let's assume it is a point with x₁ = 1 and y₁ = 1. 
1. Write down the coordinates of the second point as well. Let's take a point with x₂ = 2 and y₂ = 3.
1. Use the slope intercept formula to find the slope: `m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁) = (3-1)/(2-1) = 2/1 = 2`.
1. Calculate the y-intercept: `b = y₁ - m * x₁ = 1 - 2*1 = -1`. You can also use x₂ and y₂ instead of x₁ and y₂ here.
1. Put all these values together to construct the slope intercept form of a linear equation: `y = 2x - 1`.
1. You can also use the <portal cid="144">distance calculator</portal> to find the distance between the two points.

## x-intercept and y-intercept

You can also find the x-intercept of the line. It is the value of x at which the straight line crosses the x-axis (it means the value of x for which y = 0). You can calculate it in the following way:

`0 = mx + b`

`x = -b/m`

Our slope intercept calculator will display the values of x-intercept and y-intercept for you.

## Real world use cases of y-intercept and x-intercept (kelvin scale)

To understand why the slope intercept form is so useful and what kind of applications it can have in the real world, let's see a couple of examples. Let us start with simple ones from physics, so that you can get an intuitive idea of what the y-intercept and x-intercept mean.

Imagine we have a car moving at a certain speed. We can plot this movement as the time versus the distance from the car to us. This means that the x-axis will represent the time passed and the y-axis will tell us about the distance to the car. We can even imagine the car having started to move before we started the timer (so before `t=0`).

Now if we look at the y-intercept (`x = 0`) it is the point at which we started to keep track of time (`t=0`). And so, the value of `y` will tell us the position (distance) of the car with respect to us. This value is, like we have discussed before, the same as the value of `b` in the slop intercept form of a straight line equation.

Looking now at the x-intercept (`y=0`) this will be the point at which the distance from the car to us will be `0`. Then the value of `x` at this point will be the time when we and the car where at the same place. Let's hope that means we were inside the car, and not under.

## Other equations with y-intercept

The example above is a very simple one that should help you understand why the slope intercept form is important and more specifically, the meaning of the `x/y -intercept`. In this article we are mostly talking about straight line, but the intercept points can be calculated for any kind of curve.

In fact the example above does not require a linear equation and would be the same for a parabola or any other shape, except for the slope intercept form which might have other names(if any at all).

One equations that is guaranteed to have a y-intercept but not necessarily an x-intercept is the <portal cid=485>Parabola</portal>. This is an equation with the same shown in the image. It has a maximum (or a minimum depending on the orientation) and if this maximum (minimum) is below (above) the x-axis there will never be an x-intercept.


However, unlike humans, not all equations are equal. Some of the formulas describe curves that might never intercept the x-axis, or the y-axis or both. Let's see in a bit more detail how this can be.

## Equations with NO why intercept (asymptote)

We can distinguish 3 groups of equations depending on whether they have y-intercept only, x-intercept only or none of them. In the first group (only y intercept) we can have almost any type of equation, including linear equations. A good easy example is `y = 3` (or any other constant value of y except for `0`) since this is a line parallel to the x-axis and will, thus, never cross or intercept it.

The second and third group of equations are a bit more tricky to imagine and to understand them well we need to introduce the concept of an **asymptote**. An asymptote is a line (can be expressed as a linear equation) to which the function or curve we are talking about gets closer and closer but that it never crosses or touches.

The definition might not seem totally clear but if we look at an **example equation**, we will have less problems understanding. Let's take the equation `y = 1/x`. If we try to **find the y-intercept** by substituting `x=0` we arrive at what is called a **mathematically undefined expression** since it makes no sense to divide by `0`. 

If we take values closer and closer to `0` (something like `0.1`, then `0.001`, `0.000001`...) we can see that the vale of `y` increases very rapidly. So around the point `x=0` we know that `y` would have a huge value but because of how maths work it does not have a defined value for that exact point. Sometimes people may say `1/0 = infinity` but the reality is that **infinity is not a number but a concept**.

In this case the linear equation `x = 0` represents the asymptote of the function `y = 1/x` which means that `y = 1/x` will never intercept that line and thus, will not have a y-intercept. In general any time that a function has an asymptote that corresponds with one of the axis, it will be missing at least one of the intercepting points.

In fact the example we have shown with `y = 1/x` has also an asymptote for `y=0`, i.e.: the x-axis. For the same reason as before `y=0` is never achievable by the formula because it would require `x=infinite` and as we said before it is impossible to achieve that since infinity is a concept and not a number.

Before we move to our next topic it is important to note that we have made extreme over-simplifications when talking about infinity, but we feel is a good and fast approach for those not used to the concept of working with infinity in maths. For those keen in learning more about _the proper ways of the infinity_ we do recommend to do so, maybe starting with the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_(mathematics)>undefined expressions in maths</a> and following form there.

## Intercepts and linear equations to solve the most important problems in the world

One could easily think that the usefulness of linear equations is very limited due to their simplicity. However the reality is a bit different, linear equations are at the core of some of the most powerful methods to solve minimization/optimization problems.
