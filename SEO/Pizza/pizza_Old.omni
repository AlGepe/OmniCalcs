How many times have you wondered if it's better to get 2 medium pizzas or just 1 large?  Probably quite many.  What pizzerias usually tell you is a diameter of the pie. But we don't eat the diameter. We don't eat a <portal cid="288">circumference</portal>.  What we eat is the area of a pie. It's a very basic math that revolves around the `Area = Radius^2 * Pi` equation but often we're in too much hurry or just can't be bothered to calculate it in our heads. That's why we built this pizza comparison tool to solve those problems once and forever.

The calculator requires from you minimum effort. Simply type in the diameter, price and number of smaller pizzas and repeat it for larger pizza(s) you're considering. Tool will show you the total area and price of each and how they compare against each other, expressed as a <portal cid="404">percentage</portal>. If you just want to compare the sizes you're free to skip the prices - tool will work either way. Units will be defaulted to your country's units but feel free to switch between metric and imperial system as you wish or maybe grab some 3000 millimeters worth of pizza!

It's worth noting that almost always it's more cost-effective to opt for a larger pizza.  As is the case in any other industry, pizzerias have better <portal cid="33">margins</portal> / <portal cid="253">markups</portal> on smaller products. The table below shows how quickly areas grow as the pizza diameter increases and as a result 18-inch pizza is over 3 times larger than a 10-inch one. At the same time grabbing a monster 61-centimeter pizza will feed more people than 2 40-centimeter ones or nearly 6 25-cm pies.
