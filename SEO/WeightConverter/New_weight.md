The weight converter tool in this web page is **the best tool for converting between different weight units**. Not only do we include a _live_ weight conversion tool but also a weight conversion chart or weight conversion table that allows to convert lbs to kg or kg to lbs, or oz to stones... At a glance. We will also explain in this article **what is weight, discuss if weight is a force** or not and even touch briefly on bodyweight, health issues and **how to lose weight** (and how to gain weight) for those interested.


## What is weight (and why none of these units measure weight)

Before we begin talking about weight units and how to convert between them, we need to issue a **HUGE DISCLAIMER**. The real (technical) definition of weight is very different from what we understand in our everyday life. Technically speaking weight is a force, in particular the force exerted by the Earth (or other planet) on an object, and as such it cannot be measured in kilograms, or pounds, or tons... Only in Newtons and equivalent units.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/technically.png" alt="funny joke about pedantic people" style="width:60%" align="center"> </p>

What we normally call __"weight"__ in our everyday life is technically referred to as `Mass` and it measures the amount of matter in an object. Because the <portal cid="438">gravitational force</portal> that the Earth exerts on us is effectively constant, **we can utilise mass and weight almost interchangeably** by just multiplying or diving by the gravitational field on the surface of the Earth `g`. If you still wish to know more about the real units of weight, they are the same as force and you can find almost all of them in our <portal cid="1145">force converter</portal> and even play with conversion tables as well.

To avoid confusion or unnecessary complications we will now talk about **mass units referring to them as weight units**, that is **we will adopt the common way of speaking** in stead of the technical one. For those who would like to be more technical and precise we will remind them that an object of `1kg` mass on the Earth will weigh at `9.8N`. But hereafter we will simply say that this object _"weighs 1kg"_.

## Converting from different units of weight

When it comes to converting from one weight unit to another by hand it might be easy (from kilograms to grams you just multiply kg by 1000) or _not so easy_ (like from lbs to kg or kg to lbs), but using an only weight converter like this one takes any difficulty out of the equation.

With this <portal cid="207">weight converter</portal> you can easily and effortlessly convert kg to pounds (and re-convert pounds to kg), grams to stones or any other two units you desire. We offer below the full list of available units:

* `microgram (Âµg)` - 1 millionth of a gram
* `milligram (mg)` - 1 thousandth of a gram
* `gram (g)`
* `kilogram (kg)` - 1 thousand grams, but a kilogram is a default unit in the metric system
* `metric ton (t)` - 1000 kilograms
* `grain (gr)` - 1/7000 of a pound
* `drachm (dr)` - 1/16 of an ounce, 1/256 of a pound
* `ounce (oz)` - 1/16 of a pound
* `pound (lb)` - basic unit in the US
* `stone (st)` - 14 pounds. Often used to quote a person's weight mostly in the UK and Ireland.
* `US ton, also called a short ton` - 2000 pounds
* `long ton, used in US` - 2240 pounds

To quickly look up values between main units feel free to **use weight conversion chart below**. Conversion charts and conversion tables are a very visual way to find the equivalence between different units of any magnitude, not only weight. For example there **exists similar conversion tables for length** like on our own <portal cid="208">length conversion tool</portal>, <portal cid="206">temperature conversion tool</portal> or the <portal cid="205">density converter</portal> to name a few.

For a full list of conversion tools from Omni you can visit the <a href="https://www.omnicalculator.com/conversion">Omnicalculator Converter section</a>.

## Weight conversion chart

To quickly find values **expressed in multiple units you can use our weight conversion charts** (known also as weight conversion tables) that can be created in this web page. Below we attach probably the most standard weight conversion chart available which **compares between kilograms, ounces, pounds and stones**, making it easy to convert from kg to lbs (and back from lbs to kg), from kg to ounces...

<later>Other common weight conversion charts include those conversion from grams to ounces, kilograms to pounds (kg to lbs), pounds to grams, tons to stones... And the other way arounf: pounds to kilograms (lbs to kg), ounces to grams... Tables will vary depending on countries and measuring systems used.</later>

## How to build a weight conversion table?

The table above includes only **4 out of 12 units we have available in this weight conversion tool**. To build your own simply choose the desired units from the drop-down menus and type in the desired values. The tool will return results in real time in each of the other 3 units. <later>Weight conversion between metric units is quite basic and for regular numbers can be performed without any table - e.g. 1 kilograms = 1000 grams or 1 ton equals 1000 kilograms. Things get a **bit more complicated when using the imperial system**. Here for example 1 stone = 14 pounds which equals 224 ounces.</later><later>Conversion between systems requires using a calculator above, as 1 kilogram = 35.274 ounces, 0.15757 stones and 2.2046 pounds. Try building the weight conversion table with the calculator in any configuration you desire.</later>


## Understanding a weight converter (weight units explained)

Like with any other magnitude, there are several systems (and units within each system) to measure weight (mass). The most popular and widespread of them is, as always, the **International System and its units: kilogram**, gram, decagram... We will talk in depth about these units later. Another major system of units is the **Imperial System with units such as the pound (lbs)**, ounce (oz)... These are not the only systems/units used in the world, so we will now explain in more detail some of the ost common units.

### Pound (lb)

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Fotothek_df_tg_0000212_Waage.jpg" alt="Old picture of people weighing objects" style="width:60%" align="center"> </p>

The pound is probably the **most used non-SI unit** for measuring weight. It is mostly used in countries that have not yet adopted the International System such as the **US, UK, Canada...** The pound has its **origin in the roman _libra_**, hence the abbreviation to lb. From there it evolved into the British pound (with various definitions and values) until what we now know as the pound.

An important remark about the pound is the fact that in the beginnings it was used to **measure both force and/or mass** which should not surprise you if you have read the disclaimer above. When the difference between mass and force was understood, the pound was divided into **pound-mass and pound-force** depending on what quantity they measure. As we have explained before, they are both pretty much equivalent as long as we stay in the same planet.

The value of the pound is **no longer different from place to place** and has begin legally regulated to a fixed value for everyone, everywhere. Since in science SI-units are used and (as we will see in a moment) they put a **lot of effort into perfectly defining the kilogram**, it is only natural to define the pound in relation to the kilogram. The pound is **legally defined** in terms of the conversion **lbs to kg** as `1 lb = 0.45359237 kilograms` which leads to a conversion from kg to lbs of `1kg = 2.20462lbs`

### Stone (st)

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Moelen.jpg/800px-Moelen.jpg" alt="Stones" style="width:60%" align="center"> </p>

It is easy to understand where the name **stone comes from historically**: it dates back to the times when people measured the weight of objects by putting a similar weight of stones on the other side of a Roman-style balance. With the evolution of measuring techniques the unit got standardized to what is now the stone, meaning that **its value does not depend on the size of the stone you chose** any more.

The stone is used mostly in the **British Islands and Ireland**, most commonly to measure **people's weight** rather than as an everyday unit. You might weigh 20st because you ate too much for too long but, ironically, you would measure the weight of your food in pounds. The definition of a stone is officially: `1st = 14 pounds = 6.35029318 kg`

### Ounce (oz)

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/1_oz_of_fine_gold.jpg" alt="Ounce of gold" style="width:60%" align="center"> </p>

The last unit we will explain in detail is the **ounce** because it is the last piece of the **Imperial System units** "puzzle"". Just like the stone and the pound, **the ounce has a historical customary origin** which means that for many years people used the ounce unit with **no standardized value across all regions until fairly recently**. Once we understood the importance of being able to efficiently communicate measurements between regions, countries or continents, the ounce also got a proper definition as such.

The definition of the ounce, however is much easier to do within the Imperial System since **the ounce is defined as 1/16lb**. From there one can convert from lbs to kg to obtain the SI value of an ounce. It is possible to do it the other way around to get ounces from kilograms: you only need to convert from kg to lbs and then to ounces. The equivalences are as follows: `1lbs = 16 oz = 0.45359237 kgs` and `1oz = 0625 lbs = 0283495kg`


## SI units and redefining the kg

We have seen some of the units used for measuring weight, now let's dive deeper on **how the kilogram of them is defined**. To begin the story we need to remember that it all started for the need of standardization in a world where people would **measure lengths with their own feet** and weights with arbitrary stones. The need for a common unit that will always measure the same amount in every part of the world was clear.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2013/07/13/10/43/weights-157664_960_720.png" alt="redifining the kilogram" style="width:60%" align="center"> </p>

This is how the **scientific quest for the perfect standard** begun. A perfect scientific standard should not only be always the same for everyone (like following a reference design) but one **defined by nature itself** and one that we could always refer back to even if everything in the world would get destroyed.

The first definition of the kilogram was: **The weight of a liter of water**. Which is already better than "the weight of a stone" but has problems. Some of them due to the fact that the density of water changes with temperature and pressure making it necessary to set some common values for those magnitudes as well. But **the big problem is that the defintion includes other man-made units**, meaning that if we lose the definition of a litre (or we get it wrong) the kilogram will not be correctly defined any more.

In fact, even today the kilogram is still **defined based on a piece of metal** safely stored in Paris with copies all over the world. But this will not last since there are **currently 2 approaches by different scientists to redefine for once and for all the kilogram**. The first approach tries to define the kilogram <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo0jm1PPRuo"> in terms of Planck's constant and Avogadro's number</a> using a electromagnetic balance and some clever physics.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZMByI4s-D-Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The second approach (which you can see in the video above) uses **the purest most perfect sphere of Silicon** to obtain the number of _Si14_ that are contained in precisely one kilogram. We would then have a new definition of a kilogram in terms of **the number of Silicon 14 atoms** needed to achieve such weight. 

It is important to note that this will not change the actual value of a kilogram or how we convert kg to pounds. It would just **give us a way to re-create a kilogram** (and all other units) even if we lose the reference kilogram, or if we move to a different planet where the conditions might be very different.

## Is weight a force? Can we have a mass to weight conversion table?

We have mentioned before that **mass and weight are not the same but we can treat them as the same** as long as we stay on the Earth. Now we will see a very classical example that will help us see why this is the case. The experiment we will deal with is the **famous Galilean free-fall experiment**. We will consider the experiment without any air resistance first. 

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Pisa_experiment.png" alt="Galilean free-fall experiment helps understand mass and weight conversion" style="width:60%" align="center"> </p>

Briefly explained the experiment consists in **dropping 2 objects with the same mass/weight from a certain height**. In the case where there is no <portal cid="439">force of friction</portal> (air resistance is zero) both objects should land at the same time. To learn more about the experiment itself we recommend checking out our <portal cid="451">free-fall calculator</portal>, since here we will focus on the **relationship between force and weight**.

We **avoid talking about the experiment of **<poral cid="711">**free-fall with air resistance**</portal> because in that situation the shape of the objects becomes important. Also you would have to watch out for changes in air density (about which you can learn more on our <portal cid="585">air density calculator<portal>). All this would only take away from the **important factors that we want to talk about: weight, mass and gravity**

The reason we can talk about weight and mass in our daily life is that they are both proportional, let's see that using <portalcid="1170">Newton's second law</portal>. This law states that the **force and mass are proportional to the acceleration** for any one object. `F = m * a` where `F` is the force (for us now is the _weight_), `m` is the mass of the object, and `a` is the acceleration which for a falling object is `g` or the **gravitational field**.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://ecdn.teacherspayteachers.com/thumbitem/Mass-vs-Weight-Interactive-Notebook-Foldable-2864355-1507496624/original-2864355-2.jpg" alt="Mass and weight are not the same thing, but similar" style="width:60%" align="center"> </p>

The important part of this experiment is that for all objects on the Earth the **acceleration downwards will always be the same**: `g = 9.8 m/sÂ²`. This means that the weight `F` and the mass `m` are still not the same thing but they are **exactly proportional** so you can from weight convert into mass and vice versa. A weight conversion chart or a weight conversion table should never (technically) have kg to lbs or pounds to kg conversion, but if we forget about the technicalities **we could still talk about forces in kg** and mass in pounds without any problem of communication.

Well... That is not totally true. If we move from **one planet to another, this start to get a bit more complicated**. We will now talk about this scenario which should also help explain the difference between mass and weight in a more clear way.

## A guide on weight and mass for interplanetary travellers

We have already seen than **mass and weight are interchangeable if we stay in one planet** like the Earth, because the value of acceleration/gravitational field is always the same. However, when we move from one planet to another the value of `g` will most likely change and so will the relationship between mass and weight. This makes it **impractical to talk about weight in units of mass** (from lbs to kg, through grams and stones) and we need to be more careful about the technicalities. Let's see how this happens.


<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/497122924000444417/1240/10/scaletowidth" alt="Weight changes in different planet, but the mass doesn't" style="width:60%" align="center"> </p>

Each planet has a different composition in terms of mass, radius... Which means that the **gravitational acceleration/field will  not be the same** when we move to a different planet. This translates in the same object (with the same mass all the time) will have different weight depending on the planet they are on. If you don't believe me you can see this effect on our <portal cid="347"> weight on other planets calculator</portal> and even make your own weight conversion table. Only it will **convert weight from one planet into another**, in stead of convert pounds to kg or convert kg to lbs.

In **practical terms** this all means that even though the mass of one body does not change depending on the planet, the weight does. So if we would like to keep talking about weight in kilograms we will need to also specify the `g` value on each planet, which **makes it less convenient**. One exception would be if we found a planet with the same size and mass as the Earth. This planet will have the same density (which you can check with our <portal cid="204">density calculator</portal>).

Another instance in which the mass and the **weight can change independently** is when we get submerged in a liquid, such as water. In this case the value of `g` is the same all the time but a **new effect comes into play: buoyancy**. This is the force that a liquid exerts upwards on a body inside of it, so it counters the force called weight. You can learn more about the buoyancy and its properties on our <portal cid="607"> buoyancy calculator</portal>, but you probably already know about this phenomenon under the name of **Arquimedes principle** and the story on how he helped the king spot a counterfeit golden crown just using water.

## Weight of human body obsessions, rules, tricks.... (shameless mega-plug of millions of Omni calculators)

So far we have discussed weight, how to use the weight converter, different weight conversion tables and weight units... Basically we have talked about **weight (or mass) as a physical quantity**, that is just from the physics side of it. However, the most interesting or talked aspect of weight is that relating our own body weight.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2018/07/23/13/54/diet-3556961_960_720.jpg" alt="Losing body weight is an obssesion for many nowadays" style="width:60%" align="center"> </p>

From a beauty point of view to the health aspect of it, weight and **body weight is something that matters most of us**. It is such a broad topic that it would take several days worth of reading to cover it, but since you are already here and this topic might matter a lot to you, we will just mention **some key points and resources**. We are confident you will find very helpful information from our <a href="">Health Calculators</a> and also from the calculators in the <a href="">Sports section</a>

As a rule of thumb **more activity and a healthy diet** are always good for your health. If you can, commuting by bike is very healthy for you and for the environment as you can see using our <portal cid="833">Car vs bike</portal> comparison tool. Walking is also advisable, but by far the **best thing you can do for your health is quite smoking, now**. We'll provide you with some help using our <portal cid="378">Smoking recovery calculator</portal> that will show you **how much longer you will live** after making the change.


### Does body weight really matters for your health?

The simple reality of the body weight connection with health is that **only a medical exam can properly tell you**. But short of that (or before you actually take one) there are **several indicators that can help you get an idea** of whether you should be concerned about your health or not. One of the most common ones is the <portal cid="81">BMI indicator</portal> which gives healthy and unhealthy ranges for body weight with respect to height. Alternatively you can learn more about your "ideal weight" using our <portal cid="226"> ideal weight calculator</portal>.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Healthy_food.jpg" alt="Skinny doesn't mean healthy, it's all about balance" style="width:60%" align="center"> </p>

Despite being widely used, BMI is not the _"be all and end all"_ indicator since, for example, many **high level athletes tend to rank "Obese"** in such marker. This is because it doesn't measure the amount of fat in one's body (which is the main risk factor) so that the amount of water in your body (which you can estimate with out <portal cid="777">Water calculator by body weight</portal>) could also affect your BMI as can muscle as well. 

The **best option is to get a body composition exam** but you can also estimate your <portal cid="123"> lean body mass</portal> using our calculator. And if you can get such a body composition exam, why not compare how you would stack up compared to some elite forces using our <portal cid="232">army body fat calculator</portal>?

### How to lose weight in a healthy manner

The desire to lose or gain weight comes hand in hand with **caring about your health and physique**, and the only correct to do it is **following professional advice**. However, as we've said before when talking about body weight, there are several broad guidelines that are generally accepted as **healthy ways to lose weight: watch your diet and exercise**. Let's see now some tools that can help you in such endeavour. For weight loss we will divide the tools into two different sections: diet, and exercise. To properly lose weight we would advice doing both with moderation but any of them on its own should yield results.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://www.hawaiitribune-herald.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/web1_Marcus-Cook---Big-to-Little--Finish-Line-Cutout-_ne20181011181752317.jpg" alt="From fat to fit, how to lose weight" style="width:60%" align="center"> </p>

To lose weight by means of **controlling your food intake** we would recommend a wonderful calculator we made here called <portal cid="231">Food Calories</portal> that will help you be mindful of what you're putting in your body and adapt it to your needs. If you are serious about **losing weight you need to weigh your food**, at least until you get a sense for how much food weighs. It is also important to control your <portal cid="742"> macros for weight loss</portal> since not all calories are equally healthy and we always need **at least a bit of everything**, which is one of the reasons eggs, chickpeas, kale... Are so popular lately. As a small extra we would recommend checking our food calculators like the marvellous <portal cid="815">egg boiling calculator</portal> that will help you get those **eggs perfectly cooked** to your liking every single time.

On the other hand we have exercising, which **not only will help you lose weight but will also make you healthier** over all. For weight loss there are 2 approaches to exercising: steady state cardio and High Intensity Interval training (HIIT). **Steady state cardio** helps you burn more calories overall as well as make your body slimmer in the long run. These exercises include <portal cid="535">walking</portal>, <portal cid="1159">running for weight loss</portal>, <portal cid="873">cycling for weight loss</portal>... Heck! You can even go <portal cid="341">catch pokemon</portal> if you're still into that. These types of exercises are typically long and low intensity efforts that help your body burn more fat than it would normally. A great example (and a huge milestone for those looking for a challenge) is the marathon, about which you can learn more in our <portal cid="708">marathon pace calculator</portal>.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2280/32695901081_88b085f0d2_z.jpg" alt="weight lifting is a valid answer for how to lose weight" style="width:60%" align="center"> </p>

The problem with these types of exercises is that **require a lot of time and can even get boring** for some people. That's where HIIT comes in handy. These are short but very intense exercises done in quick succession with short periods of rest in between. This type of exercises include weight lifting (or technically _"mass lifting"_ ;P ) and they **burn more fat per minute than cardio**. HIIT exercises usually lead to muscle gains so even if your overall weight won't drop as much as with pure cardio, **some would argue it's even better** cause it helps you look better and be more capable in general. Typical exercises include squats, dead lifts, curls (of many types) and the ever-popular <portal cid="122"> bench press</portal>

### How to gain weight in a healthy manner

When it comes to to gaining weight in a healthy manner the general advice is the same: **watch your diet and exercise**. But there are some caveats as to what specifically you should do. When it comes to eating you will be looking at **taking in more calories than your body will burn** so that you can get heavier, the key is to still eat healthy so that you can build lean mass and not just fat. 

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://madnessmedia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/YoutubeThumb5-800x449.png" alt="Robert Forstemann is a testament that you can be a cyclist and still be strong" style="width:60%" align="center"> </p>

As for exercising the general advice is to **prioritize HIIT type of training over cardio**. That doesn't mean only do HIIT or that you cannot gain weight without going to the gym, but the _"iron church"_, as some call it, is probably **your best option**. However **running and cycling can still be used for gaining weight**, but you should shift focus to short-intense sprints rather than "long miles". An example of this is very high <portal cid ="878">cycling wattage</portal> competitions such as track events where athletes have to perform around their zone 4-5 of their <portal cid="874">hr zones</portal>. For anyone who disagrees with this last bit show them the picture of the **cyclist just over this text**.
