The weight converter tool in this web page is the best tool for converting between different weight units. Not only do we include a _live_ weight conversion tool but also a weight conversion chart or weight conversion table That allows to convert lbs to kg or kg to lbs, or oz to stones... At a glance. We will also explain in this article what is weight, discuss if weight is a force or not and even touch briefly on how to lose weight (and how to gain weight) for those interested.

## What is weight (and why none of these units measure weight)

Before we begin talking about weight units and how to convert between them, we need to issue a **HUGE DISCLAIMER**. The real (technical) definition of weight is very different from what we understand in our everyday life. Technically speaking weight is a force, in particular the force exerted by the Earth (or other planet) on an object, and as such it cannot be measured in kilograms, or pounds, or tons... Only in Newtons and equivalent units.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/technically.png" alt="funny joke about pedantic people" style="width:60%" align="center"> </p>

What we normally call __"weight"__ in our everyday life is technically referred to as `Mass` and it measures the amount of matter in an object. Because the <portal cid="438">gravitational force</portal> that the Earth exerts on us is effectively constant, **we can utilise mass and weight almost interchangeably** by just multiplying or diving by the gravitational field on the surface of the Earth `g`.

To avoid confusion or unnecessary complications we will now talk about **mass units referring to them as weight units**, that is **we will adopt the common way of speaking** in stead of the technical one. For those who would like to be more technical and precise we will remind them that an object of `1kg` mass on the Earth will weigh at `9.8N`. But hereafter we will simply say that this object _"weighs 1kg"_.

## Converting from different units of weight

When it comes to converting from one weight unit to another by hand it might be easy (from kilograms to grams you just multiply kg by 1000) or _not so easy_ (like from lbs to kg or kg to lbs), but using an only weight converter like this one takes any difficulty out of the equation.

With this <portal cid="207">weight converter</portal> you can easily and effortlessly convert kg to pounds (and re-convert pounds to kg), grams to stones or any other two units you desire. We offer below the full list of available units:

* `microgram (Âµg)` - 1 millionth of a gram
* `milligram (mg)` - 1 thousandth of a gram
* `gram (g)`
* `kilogram (kg)` - 1 thousand grams, but a kilogram is a default unit in the metric system
* `metric ton (t)` - 1000 kilograms
* `grain (gr)` - 1/7000 of a pound
* `drachm (dr)` - 1/16 of an ounce, 1/256 of a pound
* `ounce (oz)` - 1/16 of a pound
* `pound (lb)` - basic unit in the US
* `stone (st)` - 14 pounds. Often used to quote a person's weight mostly in the UK and Ireland.
* `US ton, also called a short ton` - 2000 pounds
* `long ton, used in US` - 2240 pounds

To quickly look up values between main units feel free to use weight conversion chart below. Conversion charts and conversion tables are a very visual way to find the equivalence between different units of any magnitude, not only weight. For example there exists similar conversion tables for length like on our own <portal cid="208">length conversion tool</portal>, <portal cid="206">temperature conversion tool</portal> or the <portal cid="205">density converter</portal> to name a few.

## Weight conversion chart

To quickly find values expressed in multiple units you can use our weight conversion charts (known also as weight conversion tables) that can be created in this web page. Below we attach probably the most standard weight conversion chart available which compares between kilograms, ounces, pounds and stones, making it easy to convert from kg to lbs (and back from lbs to kg), from kg to ounces...

<later>Other common weight conversion charts include those conversion from grams to ounces, kilograms to pounds (kg to lbs), pounds to grams, tons to stones... And the other way arounf: pounds to kilograms (lbs to kg), ounces to grams... Tables will vary depending on countries and measuring systems used.</later>

## How to build a weight conversion table?

The table above includes only 4 out of 12 units we have available in this weight conversion tool. To build your own simply choose the desired units from the drop-down menus and type in the desired values. The tool will return results in real time in each of the other 3 units. <later>Weight conversion between metric units is quite basic and for regular numbers can be performed without any table - e.g. 1 kilograms = 1000 grams or 1 ton equals 1000 kilograms. Things get a bit more complicated when using the imperial system. Here for example 1 stone = 14 pounds which equals 224 ounces.</later><later>Conversion between systems requires using a calculator above, as 1 kilogram = 35.274 ounces, 0.15757 stones and 2.2046 pounds. Try building the weight conversion table with the calculator in any configuration you desire.</later>


## Different units for weight

Like with any other magnitude, there are several systems (and units within each system) to measure weight (mass). The most popular and widespread of them is, as always, the **International System and its units: kilogram**, gram, decagram... We will talk in depth about these units later. Another major system of units is the **Imperial System with units such as the pound (lbs)**, ounce (oz)... These are not the only systems/units used in the world, so we will now explain in more detail some of the ost common units.

### Pound (lb)

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Fotothek_df_tg_0000212_Waage.jpg" alt="Old picture of people weighing objects" style="width:60%" align="center"> </p>

The pound is probably the **most used non-SI unit** for measuring weight. It is mostly used in countries that have not yet adopted the International System such as the **US, UK, Canada...** The pound has its **origin in the roman _libra_**, hence the abbreviation to lb. From there it evolved into the British pound (with various definitions and values) until what we now know as the pound.

An important remark about the pound is the fact that in the beginnings it was used to **measure both force and/or mass** which should not surprise you if you have read the disclaimer above. When the difference between mass and force was understood, the pound was divided into **pound-mass and pound-force** depending on what quantity they measure. As we have explained before, they are both pretty much equivalent as long as we stay in the same planet.

The value of the pound is **no longer different from place to place** and has begin legally regulated to a fixed value for everyone, everywhere. Since in science SI-units are used and (as we will see in a moment) they put a **lot of effort into perfectly defining the kilogram**, it is only natural to define the pound in relation to the kilogram. The pound is **legally defined** in terms of the conversion **lbs to kg** as `1 lb = 0.45359237 kilograms` which leads to a conversion from kg to lbs of `1kg = 2.20462lbs`

### Stone (st)

It is easy to understand where the name **stone comes from historically**: it dates back to the times when people measured the weight of objects by putting a similar weight of stones on the other side of a Roman-style balance. With the evolution of measuring techniques the unit got standardized to what is now the stone, meaning that **its value does not depend on the size of the stone you chose** any more.

The stone is used mostly in the **British Islands and Ireland**, most commonly to measure **people's weight** rather than as an everyday unit. You might weigh 20st because you ate too much for too long but, ironically, you would measure the weight of your food in pounds. The definition of a stone is officially: `1st = 14 pounds = 6.35029318 kg`

### Ounce (oz)

The last unit we will explain in detail is the **ounce** because it is the last piece of the **Imperial System units** "puzzle"". Just like the stone and the pound, **the ounce has a historical customary origin** which means that for many years people used the ounce unit with **no standardized value across all regions until fairly recently**. Once we understood the importance of being able to efficiently communicate measurements between regions, countries or continents, the ounce also got a proper definition as such.

The definition of the ounce, however is much easier to do within the Imperial System since **the ounce is defined as 1/16lb**. From there one can convert from lbs to kg to obtain the SI value of an ounce. It is possible to do it the other way around to get ounces from kilograms: you only need to convert from kg to lbs and then to ounces. The equivalences are as follows: `1lbs = 16 oz = 0.45359237 kgs` and `1oz = 0625 lbs = 0283495kg`


## SI units and redefining the kg

We have seen some of the units used for measuring weight, now let's dive deeper on **how the kilogram of them is defined**. To begin the story we need to remember that it all started for the need of standardization in a world where people would **measure lengths with their own feet** and weights with arbitrary stones. The need for a common unit that will always measure the same amount in every part of the world was clear.

This is how the **scientific quest for the perfect standard** begun. A perfect scientific standard should not only be always the same for everyone (like following a reference design) but one **defined by nature itself** and one that we could always refer back to even if everything in the world would get destroyed.

The first definition of the kilogram was: **The weight of a liter of water**. Which is already better than "the weight of a stone" but has problems. Some of them due to the fact that the density of water changes with temperature and pressure making it necessary to set some common values for those magnitudes as well. But **the big problem is that the defintion includes other man-made units**, meaning that if we lose the definition of a litre (or we get it wrong) the kilogram will not be correctly defined any more.

In fact, even today the kilogram is still **defined based on a piece of metal** safely stored in Paris with copies all over the world. But this will not last since there are **currently 2 approaches by different scientists to redefine for once and for all the kilogram**. The first approach tries to define the kilogram <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo0jm1PPRuo"> in terms of Planck's constant and Avogadro's number</a> using a electromagnetic balance and some clever physics.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZMByI4s-D-Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The second approach (which you can see in the video above) uses **the purest most perfect sphere of Silicon** to obtain the number of _Si14_ that are contained in precisely one kilogram. We would then have a new definition of a kilogram in terms of **the number of Silicon 14 atoms** needed to achieve such weight. 

It is important to note that this will not change the actual value of a kilogram or how we convert kg to pounds. It would just **give us a way to re-create a kilogram** (and all other units) even if we lose the reference kilogram, or if we move to a different planet where the conditions might be very different.
