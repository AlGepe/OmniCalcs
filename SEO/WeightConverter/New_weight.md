The weight converter tool in this web page is the best tool for converting between different weight units. Not only do we include a _live_ weight conversion tool but also a weight conversion chart or weight conversion table That allows to convert lbs to kg or kg to lbs, or oz to stones... At a glance. We will also explain in this article what is weight, discuss if weight is a force or not and even touch briefly on how to lose weight (and how to gain weight) for those interested.

## What is weight (and why none of these units measure weight)

Before we begin talking about weight units and how to convert between them, we need to issue a **HUGE DISCLAIMER**. The real (technical) definition of weight is very different from what we understand in our everyday life. Technically speaking weight is a force, in particular the force exerted by the Earth (or other planet) on an object, and as such it cannot be measured in kilograms, or pounds, or tons... Only in Newtons and equivalent units.

What we normally call __"weight"__ in our everyday life is technically referred to as `Mass` and it measures the amount of matter in an object. Because the <portal cid="438">gravitational force</portal> that the Earth exerts on us is effectively constant, **we can utilise mass and weight almost interchangeably** by just multiplying or diving by the gravitational field on the surface of the Earth `g`.

To avoid confusion or unnecessary complications we will now talk about **mass units referring to them as weight units**, that is **we will adopt the common way of speaking** in stead of the technical one. For those who would like to be more technical and precise we will remind them that an object of `1kg` mass on the Earth will weigh at `9.8N`. But hereafter we will simply say that this object _"weighs 1kg"_.


## Converting from different units of weight

When it comes to converting from one weight unit to another by hand it might be easy (from kilograms to grams you just multiply kg by 1000) or _not so easy_ (like from lbs to kg or kg to lbs), but using an only weight converter like this one takes any difficulty out of the equation.

With this <portal cid="207">weight converter</portal> you can easily and effortlessly convert kg to pounds (and re-convert pounds to kg), grams to stones or any other two units you desire. We offer below the full list of available units:

* `microgram (Âµg)` - 1 millionth of a gram
* `milligram (mg)` - 1 thousandth of a gram
* `gram (g)`
* `kilogram (kg)` - 1 thousand grams, but a kilogram is a default unit in the metric system
* `metric ton (t)` - 1000 kilograms
* `grain (gr)` - 1/7000 of a pound
* `drachm (dr)` - 1/16 of an ounce, 1/256 of a pound
* `ounce (oz)` - 1/16 of a pound
* `pound (lb)` - basic unit in the US
* `stone (st)` - 14 pounds. Often used to quote a person's weight mostly in the UK and Ireland.
* `US ton, also called a short ton` - 2000 pounds
* `long ton, used in US` - 2240 pounds

To quickly look up values between main units feel free to use weight conversion chart below. Conversion charts and conversion tables are a very visual way to find the equivalence between different units of any magnitude, not only weight. For example there exists similar conversion tables for length like on our own <portal cid="208">length conversion tool</portal>, <portal cid="206">temperature conversion tool</portal> or the <portal cid="205">density converter</portal> to name a few.

## Weight conversion chart

To quickly find values expressed in multiple units you can use our weight conversion charts (known also as weight conversion tables) that can be created in this web page. Below we attach probably the most standard weight conversion chart available which compares between kilograms, ounces, pounds and stones, making it easy to convert from kg to lbs (and back from lbs to kg), from kg to ounces...

<later>Other common weight conversion charts include those conversion from grams to ounces, kilograms to pounds (kg to lbs), pounds to grams, tons to stones... And the other way arounf: pounds to kilograms (lbs to kg), ounces to grams... Tables will vary depending on countries and measuring systems used.</later>

## How to build a weight conversion table?

The table above includes only 4 out of 12 units we have available in this weight conversion tool. To build your own simply choose the desired units from the drop-down menus and type in the desired values. The tool will return results in real time in each of the other 3 units. <later>Weight conversion between metric units is quite basic and for regular numbers can be performed without any table - e.g. 1 kilograms = 1000 grams or 1 ton equals 1000 kilograms. Things get a bit more complicated when using the imperial system. Here for example 1 stone = 14 pounds which equals 224 ounces.</later><later>Conversion between systems requires using a calculator above, as 1 kilogram = 35.274 ounces, 0.15757 stones and 2.2046 pounds. Try building the weight conversion table with the calculator in any configuration you desire.</later>
