## a What is temperature (brief) 

It is always hard to come up with a good definition for everyday terms, but with temperature is notoriously difficult. We all know what hot is or what cold is, but temperature? **Temperature is much harder to define without getting technical**, which is why we will get technical in just a moment. To do this we have to turn to physics, in particular to thermodynamics and statistical physics, which is like **thermodynamics meets quantum physics**.

But there is **no need to worry**, because when we dig deeper into what is temperature, the answer is as simple as confusing: <strong>temperature is <portal cid=26>speed</portal>, or rather, <portal cid=434>momentum</portal></strong> of the atoms and molecules that make up the material. What this means is that the higher the temperature of something, the higher the <portal cid=881>particles velocity</portal> faster the molecules that make up that something vibrate. This is very closely related to the concept of <portal cid=1008>thermal energy</portal> and means that heat is just another expression of <portal cid=200>kinetic energy</portal>.

As always, there's much more to this concepts than what we've mentioned here, like for example the fact that <portal cid=213>speed</portal> is related to the kinetic energy by means of a <portal cid=151>square root</portal>. Or the fact that when we mention speed we should technically speak of the <portal cid=265>average</portal> of all the speeds of all the particles... But this would, then, become a large essay on the physical concept of temperature and there would not be space for a conversion tool.

We have space and time, however, to point out some interesting facts, like how much more obvious it is that any <portal cid=439>force of friction</portal> will end up creating heat (increasing the temperature). And it is also interesting to note that once we think of temperature as a form of energy it becomes fairly clear that our body burns more <portal cid=231>calories</portal> when we try to <portal cid=1159>burn calories by running</portal> vigorously, which incidentally **creates much more heat inside out bodies than light exercising**. 

Thinking about **temperature and heat in terms of energy is very useful** and helps us understand much better many of the things that happen around us. Nevertheless that is not the only thing we will talk about. Since **this is a temperature conversion tool first**, it is only fair that we will talk about units of measuring temperature.  We also need to acknowledge the different ways that exist of measuring temperature. We're not talking only about different types of thermometers, but also about **different scales**.

We will talk about different ways of measuring temperature both in terms of temperature scales, from Celsius to Fahrenheit to Kelvin and back to Celsius; and also in terms of what properties we can use to accurately make measurements in any scale we want.

## 2 Temperature and relation with other magnitudes

_Everything is connected_ is something we hear a lot, but we barely ever consider to what extent that is true. **In physics it is an unavoidable truth, one thing affects the other**; luckily for us we know almost always how one thing affects another and we can predict those changes and use them to or advantage. We have already seen how a change in temperature involves a change in momentum by the particles, but there are **many more connections than just speed-temperature**.

Just by simply looking at the weather you can already have an intuition that temperature and <portal cid=984>pressure</portal> are closely related. And if you're into your <portal cid=878>cycling numbers</portal> you probably also know that temperatures affect air <portal cid=585>air density</portal> and, hence, <portal cid=1035>drag</portal> at a given speed. This is due to the <portal cid=440>thermal expansion</portal> of the gases in the air, with the corresponding increase in <portal cid=195>volume</portal> which translates to a drop in <portal cid=204>density</portal>, since the <portal cid=207>weight</portal> remains constant.

This whole relationship between pressure, temperature, volume (and <portal cid=205>density</portal> for that matter) is best explain by the <portal cid=435>ideal gas law</portal> equation, at least in the perfect case. We won't go into details but by using such calculator together with the air density and drag calculators you could easily see how a change in temperature can significantly change the results of an experiment like the <portal cid=711>free fall with air resistance</portal>. This is easy to correct for, but if you don't do, you might end up with strange values for the <portal cid=438>gravitational force</portal> of the Earth, that might even change from day to day!

All this relations between temperature and volume, or pressure, or speed... Depend on the properties of the material you are dealing with and it generally parametrized by physicist by quantities such as <portal cid=414>specific heat</portal>, <portal cid=1060>latent heat</portal>, <portal cid=442>thermal conductivity</portal>... And then are integrated into the theories by means of rules and laws such as <portal cid=1169>Newton's law of cooling</portal>, <portal cid=952>Joule heating</portal>...

Before we can dive any deeper into the consequences or practical applications of this connections, we probably should talk about this temperature conversion calculator, how temperature is measured, and why do we even need different units to measure temperature. Because, spoiler alert, having measurements in Celsius, and temperature in Fahrenheit or using the Kelvin temperature scale is very useful, even if that means we need to convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius to even understand each other.

## 3 Temperature Scales and conversions (brief description) 

When it comes to measuring temperature, you could say that it **is measured in degrees** and it's just that different people use different degrees. But that just delays the problem without providing a real answer, and it also makes scientist very angry since the preferred nomenclature is without the "degree" part of it. Any which way, there are many different units to measure temperature in, the most common ranging from kelvin to Celsius to Fahrenheit, **depending on the country or the type of conversation**.

However, there are **many more units of temperature**, some arguably as useless as unknown. **In this temperature unit conversion calculator we have them all** and we will let you play with weird temperature conversions, and even show you how to make your own temperature conversion table for unknown units, if you're into that sort of stuff. For now let's just mention some of them.

Among the most weird and obscure we can think of are units of temperature such as: Rankine, Delisle, Newton, Réaumur, Rømer... If you're an avid reader and follower of science you've probably noticed that they are all names of scientist. In fact, from (Lord) Kelvin to Fahrenheit to Celsius **all the units of temperature are names of those who (allegedly) created such temperature scales**.

The only exception would be the centigrade scale, which we would mention briefly later, but it's practically the same as the Celsius. The reason there are so many units is that temperature is hard to measure and there is not an obvious way to stablish proper scale. In fact, **for thousands of years nobody even knew if there was even an upper or lower limit to temperatures**, so it was very hard to stablish points of reference. 

We will see in more **detail some of the most important temperature scales**, and the temperature conversion between this commonly used scales. We will also see how natural phenomenons such as freezing point, <portal cid=423>dew point</point> or <portal cid=499>boiling points</portal> were crucial in the development of a widespread temperature scale.

## 4 Temperature conversion using the calculator 

Before we dive deeper into the temperature scales themselves we should probably take a look at how to use the tool that allows us to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius or basically from any temperature units into any other. When faced with such a problem, **your options are always twofold: either you DIY it the help of Google, or you use our easy calculator and save time**. To those who chose the first option: -_We're sorry to see you go, please come back another day_-. To the rest: let's see how to use this calculator, or any other [converstion calculators from Omni](https://www.omnicalculator.com/conversion), such as the <portal cid=208>length conversion</portal>, or the <portal cid=1118>Unix time converter</portal>.

In the particular case of the temperature conversion calculator we provide **all available units at a glance**. By default the order in which they appear is:

* Celsius
* Fahrenheit
* Kelvin
* Rankine
* Delisle
* Newton
* Réaumur
* Rømer

However, you can change it to whatever order better suits your needs. It is very easy to change the units of a particular field, and it only takes a couple clicks. Let's say that you want change the first text box from Celsius to Fahrenheit, the second one from K
Fahrenheit to Kelvin and the third one from Kelvin to Fahrenheit, all you need to do is:

1) Click over `ºC`, use the drop down menu to change units from Celsius to Fahrenheit by selecting `Fahrenheit (ºF)`.
1) Click over `ºF` on the second text box, and select `Kelvin (K)`. You now have changed the units from Fahrenheit to Kelvin on the second field.
1) Click over `K`, select `Celsius (ºC)` from the drop down menu.
1) Contemplate your masterpiece, and maybe use it to convert temperature units.

Once you have all the units in your desire position, just proceed by entering the value of temperature in your reference units and from that moment you will see it appear in all other units automatically. Don't you love technology, progress and the magic of the Internet?

Temperature conversion calculator enables a quick switch of temperature units used around the world, such as Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion. Using temperature conversion formula, the calculator returns results in respective units in real time. Rather than use typical temperature conversion table, type in any value in the calculator and get quickly results in all the other units.

## Temperature conversion formula

Celsius, also known as Centigrade, is the most common temperature measurement unit, used in almost every country. The temperature conversion to Kelvin is very straightforward: `K = C + 273.15` (and `C = K - 273.15`), while in order to perform Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion you need to use the following equation: `F = C * 1.8 + 32`, so `C = (F - 32) / 1.8`. And finally - in order to receive Kelvin value from Fahrenheits you can use the following equation: `K = (F + 459.67) * 5 / 9`. The other way around is `F = K * 9 / 5 - 459.67`. <later>However, there is no need to remember them. All these three and also reverse temperature conversion formulas are included in this tool.</later>. Other temperature units that you might encounter are:
* Rankine
* Delisle
* Newton
* Réaumur
* Rømer

## Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion

Probably the most commonly used temperature conversion is the one between Celsius and Fahrenheit as those are the only two units in common use these days. Fahrenheit, originally proposed back in 18th century, had been in common use in English-speaking world up until 1960's. Since than, almost all of them (with the exception of Unites States and several Caribbean nations) switched to the metric system and have been using it since. <later>As mentioned above Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion can be easily performed with the equation `F = C * 1.8 + 32`. Reverse equation `C = (F - 32) * 5 / 9` can be used to retrieve Celsius degrees from provided Fahrenheit value.</later>

## Temperature conversion table

In order to quickly look up values from the 8 units we mentioned in this article, a simple table, called Temperature Conversion Table, should come handy. You can find an example in [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_of_units_of_temperature#Comparison). <later>The so-called "absolute zero", the lowest temperature possible, is exactly `0` Kelvin which equals `-273.15` Celsius and `-459.67` Fahrenheit. Also according to this temperature conversion table the temperature above which ice starts melting is 0 degrees Celsius, convertible to `32` Fahrenheit and `273.15` Kelvin.</later> Based on the values received from this calculator you can make use of our other calculators, such as <portal cid="176">wind chill calculator</portal>.
