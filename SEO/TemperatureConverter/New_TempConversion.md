## a What is temperature (brief) 

It is always hard to come up with a good definition for everyday terms, but with temperature is notoriously difficult. We all know what hot is or what cold is, but temperature? **Temperature is much harder to define without getting technical**, which is why we will get technical in just a moment. To do this we have to turn to physics, in particular to thermodynamics and statistical physics, which is like **thermodynamics meets quantum physics**.

But there is **no need to worry**, because when we dig deeper into what is temperature, the answer is as simple as confusing: <strong>temperature is <portal cid=26>speed</portal>, or rather, <portal cid=434>momentum</portal></strong> of the atoms and molecules that make up the material. What this means is that the higher the temperature of something, the higher the <portal cid=881>particles velocity</portal> faster the molecules that make up that something vibrate. This is very closely related to the concept of <portal cid=1008>thermal energy</portal> and means that heat is just another expression of <portal cid=200>kinetic energy</portal>.

As always, there's much more to this concepts than what we've mentioned here, like for example the fact that <portal cid=213>speed</portal> is related to the kinetic energy by means of a <portal cid=151>square root</portal>. Or the fact that when we mention speed we should technically speak of the <portal cid=265>average</portal> of all the speeds of all the particles... But this would, then, become a large essay on the physical concept of temperature and there would not be space for a conversion tool.

We have space and time, however, to point out some interesting facts, like how much more obvious it is that any <portal cid=439>force of friction</portal> will end up creating heat (increasing the temperature). And it is also interesting to note that once we think of temperature as a form of energy it becomes fairly clear that our body burns more <portal cid=231>calories</portal> when we try to <portal cid=1159>burn calories by running</portal> vigorously, which incidentally **creates much more heat inside out bodies than light exercising**. 

Thinking about **temperature and heat in terms of energy is very useful** and helps us understand much better many of the things that happen around us. Nevertheless that is not the only thing we will talk about. Since **this is a temperature conversion tool first**, it is only fair that we will talk about units of measuring temperature.  We also need to acknowledge the different ways that exist of measuring temperature. We're not talking only about different types of thermometers, but also about **different scales**.

We will talk about different ways of measuring temperature both in terms of temperature scales, from Celsius to Fahrenheit to Kelvin and back to Celsius; and also in terms of what properties we can use to accurately make measurements in any scale we want.

## 2 Temperature and relation with other magnitudes

_Everything is connected_ is something we hear a lot, but we barely ever consider to what extent that is true. **In physics it is an unavoidable truth, one thing affects the other**; luckily for us we know almost always how one thing affects another and we can predict those changes and use them to or advantage. We have already seen how a change in temperature involves a change in momentum by the particles, but there are **many more connections than just speed-temperature**.

Just by simply looking at the weather you can already have an intuition that temperature and <portal cid=984>pressure</portal> are closely related. And if you're into your <portal cid=878>cycling numbers</portal> you probably also know that temperatures affect air <portal cid=585>air density</portal> and, hence, <portal cid=1035>drag</portal> at a given speed. This is due to the <portal cid=440>thermal expansion</portal> of the gases in the air, with the corresponding increase in <portal cid=195>volume</portal> which translates to a drop in <portal cid=204>density</portal>, since the <portal cid=207>weight</portal> remains constant.

This whole relationship between pressure, temperature, volume (and <portal cid=205>density</portal> for that matter) is best explain by the <portal cid=435>ideal gas law</portal> equation, at least in the perfect case. We won't go into details but by using such calculator together with the air density and drag calculators you could easily see how a change in temperature can significantly change the results of an experiment like the <portal cid=711>free fall with air resistance</portal>. This is easy to correct for, but if you don't do, you might end up with strange values for the <portal cid=438>gravitational force</portal> of the Earth, that might even change from day to day!

All this relations between temperature and volume, or pressure, or speed... Depend on the properties of the material you are dealing with and it generally parametrized by physicist by quantities such as <portal cid=414>specific heat</portal>, <portal cid=1060>latent heat</portal>, <portal cid=442>thermal conductivity</portal>... And then are integrated into the theories by means of rules and laws such as <portal cid=1169>Newton's law of cooling</portal>, <portal cid=952>Joule heating</portal>...

Before we can dive any deeper into the consequences or practical applications of this connections, we probably should talk about this temperature conversion calculator, how temperature is measured, and why do we even need different units to measure temperature. Because, spoiler alert, having measurements in Celsius, and temperature in Fahrenheit or using the Kelvin temperature scale is very useful, even if that means we need to convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius to even understand each other.

## 3 Temperature Scales and conversions (brief description) 

When it comes to measuring temperature, you could say that it **is measured in degrees** and it's just that different people use different degrees. But that just delays the problem without providing a real answer, and it also makes scientist very angry since the preferred nomenclature is without the "degree" part of it. Any which way, there are many different units to measure temperature in, the most common ranging from kelvin to Celsius to Fahrenheit, **depending on the country or the type of conversation**.

However, there are **many more units of temperature**, some arguably as useless as unknown. **In this temperature unit conversion calculator we have them all** and we will let you play with weird temperature conversions, and even show you how to make your own temperature conversion table for unknown units, if you're into that sort of stuff. For now let's just mention some of them.

Among the most weird and obscure we can think of are units of temperature such as: Rankine, Delisle, Newton, Réaumur, Rømer... If you're an avid reader and follower of science you've probably noticed that they are all names of scientist. In fact, from (Lord) Kelvin to Fahrenheit to Celsius **all the units of temperature are names of those who (allegedly) created such temperature scales**.

The only exception would be the centigrade scale, which we would mention briefly later, but it's practically the same as the Celsius. The reason there are so many units is that temperature is hard to measure and there is not an obvious way to stablish proper scale. In fact, **for thousands of years nobody even knew if there was even an upper or lower limit to temperatures**, so it was very hard to stablish points of reference. 

We will see in more **detail some of the most important temperature scales**, and the temperature conversion between this commonly used scales. We will also see how natural phenomenons such as freezing point, <portal cid=423>dew point</point> or <portal cid=499>boiling points</portal> were crucial in the development of a widespread temperature scale.

## 4 Temperature conversion using the calculator 

Before we dive deeper into the temperature scales themselves we should probably take a look at how to use the tool that allows us to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius or basically from any temperature units into any other. When faced with such a problem, **your options are always twofold: either you DIY it the help of Google, or you use our easy calculator and save time**. To those who chose the first option: -_We're sorry to see you go, please come back another day_-. To the rest: let's see how to use this calculator, or any other [converstion calculators from Omni](https://www.omnicalculator.com/conversion), such as the <portal cid=208>length conversion</portal>, or the <portal cid=1118>Unix time converter</portal>.

In the particular case of the temperature conversion calculator we provide **all available units at a glance**. By default the order in which they appear is:

* Celsius
* Fahrenheit
* Kelvin
* Rankine
* Delisle
* Newton
* Réaumur
* Rømer

However, you can change it to whatever order better suits your needs. **It is very easy to change the units of a particular field**, and it only takes a couple clicks. Let's say that you want change the first text box from Celsius to Fahrenheit, the second one from K
Fahrenheit to Kelvin and the third one from Kelvin to Fahrenheit, all you need to do is:

1) Click over `ºC`, use the drop down menu to change units from Celsius to Fahrenheit by selecting `Fahrenheit (ºF)`.
1) Click over `ºF` on the second text box, and select `Kelvin (K)`. You now have changed the units from Fahrenheit to Kelvin on the second field.
1) Click over `K`, select `Celsius (ºC)` from the drop down menu.
1) Contemplate your masterpiece, and maybe use it to convert temperature units.

Once you have all the units in your desire position, just proceed by entering the value of temperature in your reference units and from that moment you will see it appear in all other units automatically. Don't you love technology, progress and the magic of the Internet?

## 6 Celsius Scale 

The Celsius temperature scale is probably **the most widely use** of the 'non-scientific' units of temperature. It's origin dates to the 18th century, when Anders Celsius invented it. The principles behind it are as simple and easy to create as things can get. The first assumption that Anders made was that **ice water melts always at the same temperature, and it also boils at the same temperature**. So with a very well constructed thermometer (probably just a blank glass tube filled with alcohol) he put a mark for each of these points. Only he put 0 and 100

He then **created 100 divisions between these two marks** and called each of them a "_degree_". This is the reason why this scale is also called the centigrade scale: because it has a hundred (_centi_) degrees (_grade_). Since it's creation, this unit has been pretty much the **de facto standard in most countries** (not the USA) and was even the SI unit of temperature for many years, until Lord Kelvin came and created a more scientifically founded scale.

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:10px"><iframe width="600" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rjht4oAByCI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

The key achievement of this scale is to **present the temperatures that naturally occur in our everyday life with easy to use numbers**. Numbers between 0 and 100 are easy numbers to imagine, easy to manipulate and understand. It is rare that on a normal day we would encounter temperatures that would be higher than 100ºC and even more rare to find anything lower than -100ºC. 

However, there is **a problem with the Celsius scale: it's not universal**. The biggest flaw of this temperature scale is the fact that water changes its <portal cid=499>boiling point at altitude</portal>, or rather with pressure changes. It also changes it's melting point. So setting a **standardised 0ºC point or 100ºC point becomes really tricky**.

This doesn't bother too much scientists, though. They would just simply **measure all the other variables, correct for them and be done with it**. However, what concerns scientists more is the lack of universal motif behind the decisions. Why chose water and not oil? What oil? What if I would be in a different planet with different conditions, could I reproduce the scale? And hence the Kelvin scale of temperatures was born; but that's a story for another section.  

## 7 Fahrenheit scale

Much in the fashion of the Celsius scale, the Fahrenheit scale was created by a **man of science that wanted to make the best temperature scale** with the best temperature units in the universe; and he also failed. Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit, was a contemporary Dutch of Anders Celsius, that thought he could do better than the centigrade scale. The whole story of how he ended up creating the current Fahrenheit units is much better explained in the video, so we would **recommend you to watch it**.

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:10px"><iframe width="600" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rjht4oAByCI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

The Fahrenheit is as acceptable as any other scale but because of how it was conceived **seems a bit less intuitive to use** for those not used to it. Temperature conversion form `F` to `C` it's also more complicated than it is to convert Celsius to Kelvin. The temperature conversion formulas for going from Fahrenheit to Celsius and from Celsius to Fahrenheit are not very complicated. Let's see now how we can take **temperature in Fahrenheit and turn that into a temperature expressed in the metric unit** of temperature, the Celsius.

## 8 Kelvin scale 

And now onto the Temperature scale attributed to Lord Kelvin. The Kelvin scale of temperature is **currently the most widely used in science**, and for good reason. It has everything a truly scientific measuring unit should have: it's based on universal principles, it's independent of "outside" factors, and, as an extra bonus, it's defined in a way that makes temperature conversion easy for most. The size of a Kelvin was set to be the same as the Celsius degree, for convenience. 

The universality of the Kelvin comes from the fact that `0K` is exactly the **coldest temperature physically possible**, the absolute zero. It's not easy to understand how can one be sure of a temperature being **the coldest ever possible, period**; more so if we realise that it is also not possible to reach in reality. One of the trick used to arrive at this conclusion with scientific certainty is in the relationship between pressure, temperature and volume.

If you were to plot how either pressure or volume relate to temperature, you would find something fairly obvious: **pressure decreases with temperature, and so does volume**; at least in an isolated system in which all other variables are kept constant. Furthermore, you could do some analysis on this relation by means of a <portal cid=463>chi square</portal>, or <portal cid=486>linear interpolation</portal> to obtain the trend line. If you then extrapolate until you can find where the it **intercepts the axis** (just like you can do with our <portal cid=481>slope intercept calculator</portal>), you will find that the temperature at which the **volume and pressure would be 0 will be the same for most material**: `0K = -273.15ºC = 459.67ºF`.

This value is what we call absolute zero, because it would be impossible to go below it, since it would mean reaching negative pressures or negative volumes, which are **physically absurd**. This is by no means the only way to find the value of absolute zero, and more modern experiments of different nature have backed up this result through other paths. It is very surprising to think that while there is no upper limit to temperatures in the universe, the lowest temperature is something very clearly defined and independent of the system.

In terms of defining a temperature scale, however, we still need to get more data, since we have only defined one point of reference and we need at least two. The second point of reference was chosen by scientists to be the **triple point of water**. The reasons behind this decisions is that water is a fairly simple, widely available liquid, that also happens to be a requirement for life as we know it. The **triple point of water is a state in which water coexists in solid, liquid and gaseous forms** at the same time, and it is only possible to achieve at a certain pressure, and, crucially for us, temperature.

Armed with two point of reference and our desired size of the unit (same as degree Celsius), we can start setting values for common events. Under this premises, water melts at `273.15K`, and boils at `373.15K`; with the normal human body temperature sit around `306K`. This scale has the problem of dealing with fairly big number for our everyday life in pursue of a no-negative-numbers scale, which is the reason it has not become the standard unit of measurement for everyone everywhere. It is however the SI unit of temperature, and by fair the most used of all temperature units. 

Just a final remark before we move into other topics: we have been very careful to precisely say there are no "colder" temperatures than `0K` but never say "there are no negative absolute temperatures" since that would've been false. We will dedicate a bonus section for those really interested. For those the moment all you need to know is that negative absolute temperatures DO exist, they are hotter than any other positive temperature possible and only occur in very especial systems with certain properties.

## 14 Temperature and everyday life
## 15 Temperature sensors, how they work


## 9 Very cold temperatures (absolute zero) 
## 10 Very hot temperatures (mention negative absolute temps)
## 11 Temperatures in the universe
## 12 ambient, room, normal temperatures (body temperatures)
## 13 Bodily temperatures
## 16 Bonus: Negative absolute temperatures

But the world keeps spinning and moving around the sun like it always did, boiling water burns, ice is cold and there's nothing colder than `0K`; so don't worry about it too much and just continue with your life :)

Temperature conversion calculator enables a quick switch of temperature units used around the world, such as Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion. Using temperature conversion formula, the calculator returns results in respective units in real time. Rather than use typical temperature conversion table, type in any value in the calculator and get quickly results in all the other units.

## Temperature conversion formula

Celsius, also known as Centigrade, is the most common temperature measurement unit, used in almost every country. The temperature conversion to Kelvin is very straightforward: `K = C + 273.15` (and `C = K - 273.15`), while in order to perform Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion you need to use the following equation: `F = C * 1.8 + 32`, so `C = (F - 32) / 1.8`. And finally - in order to receive Kelvin value from Fahrenheits you can use the following equation: `K = (F + 459.67) * 5 / 9`. The other way around is `F = K * 9 / 5 - 459.67`. <later>However, there is no need to remember them. All these three and also reverse temperature conversion formulas are included in this tool.</later>. Other temperature units that you might encounter are:
* Rankine
* Delisle
* Newton
* Réaumur
* Rømer

## Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion

Probably the most commonly used temperature conversion is the one between Celsius and Fahrenheit as those are the only two units in common use these days. Fahrenheit, originally proposed back in 18th century, had been in common use in English-speaking world up until 1960's. Since than, almost all of them (with the exception of Unites States and several Caribbean nations) switched to the metric system and have been using it since. <later>As mentioned above Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion can be easily performed with the equation `F = C * 1.8 + 32`. Reverse equation `C = (F - 32) * 5 / 9` can be used to retrieve Celsius degrees from provided Fahrenheit value.</later>

## Temperature conversion table

In order to quickly look up values from the 8 units we mentioned in this article, a simple table, called Temperature Conversion Table, should come handy. You can find an example in [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_of_units_of_temperature#Comparison). <later>The so-called "absolute zero", the lowest temperature possible, is exactly `0` Kelvin which equals `-273.15` Celsius and `-459.67` Fahrenheit. Also according to this temperature conversion table the temperature above which ice starts melting is 0 degrees Celsius, convertible to `32` Fahrenheit and `273.15` Kelvin.</later> Based on the values received from this calculator you can make use of our other calculators, such as <portal cid="176">wind chill calculator</portal>.
