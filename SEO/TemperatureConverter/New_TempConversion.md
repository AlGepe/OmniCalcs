## 1 What is temperature (brief) 

It is always hard to come up with a good definition for everyday terms, but with temperature is notoriously difficult. We all know what hot is or what cold is, but temperature? **Temperature is much harder to define without getting technical**, which is why we will get technical in just a moment. To do this we have to turn to physics, in particular to thermodynamics and statistical physics, which is like **thermodynamics meets quantum physics**.

But there is **no need to worry**, because when we dig deeper into what is temperature, the answer is as simple as confusing: <strong>temperature is <portal cid=26>speed</portal>, or rather, <portal cid=434>momentum</portal></strong> of the atoms and molecules that make up the material. What this means is that the higher the temperature of something, the higher the <portal cid=881>particles velocity</portal> faster the molecules that make up that something vibrate. This is very closely related to the concept of <portal cid=1008>thermal energy</portal> and means that heat is just another expression of <portal cid=200>kinetic energy</portal>.

As always, there's much more to this concepts than what we've mentioned here, like for example the fact that <portal cid=213>speed</portal> is related to the kinetic energy by means of a <portal cid=151>square root</portal>. Or the fact that when we mention speed we should technically speak of the <portal cid=265>average</portal> of all the speeds of all the particles... But this would, then, become a large essay on the physical concept of temperature and there would not be space for a conversion tool.

We have space and time, however, to point out some interesting facts, like how much more obvious it is that any <portal cid=439>force of friction</portal> will end up creating heat (increasing the temperature). And it is also interesting to note that once we think of temperature as a form of energy it becomes fairly clear that our body burns more <portal cid=231>calories</portal> when we try to <portal cid=1159>burn calories by running</portal> vigorously, which incidentally **creates much more heat inside out bodies than light exercising**. 

Thinking about **temperature and heat in terms of energy is very useful** and helps us understand much better many of the things that happen around us. Nevertheless that is not the only thing we will talk about. Since **this is a temperature conversion tool first**, it is only fair that we will talk about units of measuring temperature.  We also need to acknowledge the different ways that exist of measuring temperature. We're not talking only about different types of thermometers, but also about **different scales**.

We will talk about different ways of measuring temperature both in terms of temperature scales, from Celsius to Fahrenheit to Kelvin and back to Celsius; and also in terms of what properties we can use to accurately make measurements in any scale we want.

## 2 Temperature and relation with other magnitudes

_Everything is connected_ is something we hear a lot, but we barely ever consider to what extent that is true. **In physics it is an unavoidable truth, one thing affects the other**; luckily for us we know almost always how one thing affects another and we can predict those changes and use them to or advantage. We have already seen how a change in temperature involves a change in momentum by the particles, but there are **many more connections than just speed-temperature**.

Just by simply looking at the weather you can already have an intuition that temperature and <portal cid=984>pressure</portal> are closely related. And if you're into your <portal cid=878>cycling numbers</portal> you probably also know that temperatures affect air <portal cid=585>air density</portal> and, hence, <portal cid=1035>drag</portal> at a given speed. This is due to the <portal cid=440>thermal expansion</portal> of the gases in the air, with the corresponding increase in <portal cid=195>volume</portal> which translates to a drop in <portal cid=204>density</portal>, since the <portal cid=207>weight</portal> remains constant.

This whole relationship between pressure, temperature, volume (and <portal cid=205>density</portal> for that matter) is best explain by the <portal cid=435>ideal gas law</portal> equation, at least in the perfect case. We won't go into details but by using such calculator together with the air density and drag calculators you could easily see how a change in temperature can significantly change the results of an experiment like the <portal cid=711>free fall with air resistance</portal>. This is easy to correct for, but if you don't do, you might end up with strange values for the <portal cid=438>gravitational force</portal> of the Earth, that might even change from day to day!

All this relations between temperature and volume, or pressure, or speed... Depend on the properties of the material you are dealing with and it generally paramtrized by physicist by quantities such as <portal cid=414>specific heat</portal>, <portal cid=1060>latent heat</portal>, <portal cid=442>thermal conductivity</portal>... And then are integrated into the theories by means of rules and laws such as <portal cid=1169>Newton's law of cooling</portal>, <portal cid=952>Joule heating</portal>...

Before we can dive any deeper into the consequences or practical applications of this connections, we probably should talk about this temperature conversion calculator, how temperature is measured, and why do we even need different units to measure temperature. Because, spoiler alert, having measurements in Celsius, and temperature in Fahrenheit or using the Kelvin temperature scale is very useful, even if that means we need to convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius to even understand each other.

Temperature conversion calculator enables a quick switch of temperature units used around the world, such as Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion. Using temperature conversion formula, the calculator returns results in respective units in real time. Rather than use typical temperature conversion table, type in any value in the calculator and get quickly results in all the other units.

## Temperature conversion formula

Celsius, also known as Centigrade, is the most common temperature measurement unit, used in almost every country. The temperature conversion to Kelvin is very straightforward: `K = C + 273.15` (and `C = K - 273.15`), while in order to perform Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion you need to use the following equation: `F = C * 1.8 + 32`, so `C = (F - 32) / 1.8`. And finally - in order to receive Kelvin value from Fahrenheits you can use the following equation: `K = (F + 459.67) * 5 / 9`. The other way around is `F = K * 9 / 5 - 459.67`. <later>However, there is no need to remember them. All these three and also reverse temperature conversion formulas are included in this tool.</later>. Other temperature units that you might encounter are:
* Rankine
* Delisle
* Newton
* Réaumur
* Rømer

## Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion

Probably the most commonly used temperature conversion is the one between Celsius and Fahrenheit as those are the only two units in common use these days. Fahrenheit, originally proposed back in 18th century, had been in common use in English-speaking world up until 1960's. Since than, almost all of them (with the exception of Unites States and several Caribbean nations) switched to the metric system and have been using it since. <later>As mentioned above Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion can be easily performed with the equation `F = C * 1.8 + 32`. Reverse equation `C = (F - 32) * 5 / 9` can be used to retrieve Celsius degrees from provided Fahrenheit value.</later>

## Temperature conversion table

In order to quickly look up values from the 8 units we mentioned in this article, a simple table, called Temperature Conversion Table, should come handy. You can find an example in [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_of_units_of_temperature#Comparison). <later>The so-called "absolute zero", the lowest temperature possible, is exactly `0` Kelvin which equals `-273.15` Celsius and `-459.67` Fahrenheit. Also according to this temperature conversion table the temperature above which ice starts melting is 0 degrees Celsius, convertible to `32` Fahrenheit and `273.15` Kelvin.</later> Based on the values received from this calculator you can make use of our other calculators, such as <portal cid="176">wind chill calculator</portal>.
