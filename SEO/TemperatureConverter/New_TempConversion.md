Temperature conversion calculator enables a quick switch of temperature units used around the world, such as Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion. Using temperature conversion formula, the calculator returns results in respective units in real time. Rather than use typical temperature conversion table, type in any value in the calculator and get quickly results in all the other units.

## Temperature conversion formula

Celsius, also known as Centigrade, is the most common temperature measurement unit, used in almost every country. The temperature conversion to Kelvin is very straightforward: `K = C + 273.15` (and `C = K - 273.15`), while in order to perform Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion you need to use the following equation: `F = C * 1.8 + 32`, so `C = (F - 32) / 1.8`. And finally - in order to receive Kelvin value from Fahrenheits you can use the following equation: `K = (F + 459.67) * 5 / 9`. The other way around is `F = K * 9 / 5 - 459.67`. <later>However, there is no need to remember them. All these three and also reverse temperature conversion formulas are included in this tool.</later>. Other temperature units that you might encounter are:
* Rankine
* Delisle
* Newton
* Réaumur
* Rømer

## Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion

Probably the most commonly used temperature conversion is the one between Celsius and Fahrenheit as those are the only two units in common use these days. Fahrenheit, originally proposed back in 18th century, had been in common use in English-speaking world up until 1960's. Since than, almost all of them (with the exception of Unites States and several Caribbean nations) switched to the metric system and have been using it since. <later>As mentioned above Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion can be easily performed with the equation `F = C * 1.8 + 32`. Reverse equation `C = (F - 32) * 5 / 9` can be used to retrieve Celsius degrees from provided Fahrenheit value.</later>

## Temperature conversion table

In order to quickly look up values from the 8 units we mentioned in this article, a simple table, called Temperature Conversion Table, should come handy. You can find an example in [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_of_units_of_temperature#Comparison). <later>The so-called "absolute zero", the lowest temperature possible, is exactly `0` Kelvin which equals `-273.15` Celsius and `-459.67` Fahrenheit. Also according to this temperature conversion table the temperature above which ice starts melting is 0 degrees Celsius, convertible to `32` Fahrenheit and `273.15` Kelvin.</later> Based on the values received from this calculator you can make use of our other calculators, such as <portal cid="176">wind chill calculator</portal>.
