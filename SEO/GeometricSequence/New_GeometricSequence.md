## Geometric sequence equation and geometric sequence definition

As found on the (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_progression)[Wikipedia] the geometric sequence definition is: _a collections of numbers in which all by the first one are obtained by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio_. If you are struggling to understand what is a geometric sequences just by reading this, **don't fret!** We will explain in more simple terms what this means and take a look at the recursive and explicit formula for a geometric sequence, and we will **also include a couple of geometric sequence examples**.

Before we dissect the definition properly it's important to clarify a **few things to avoid confusion**. First of all we need to understand that even though the geometric progression is made up by constantly multiplying numbers by a factor, this is not related to the <portal cid=395>factorial</portal>. What it is indeed related is to the greatest common factor (GFC) and Lowest Common Multiplier (LCM)</portal> since all but the first number share a common factor. 

This means that the <portal cid=169>GCF</portal> is simply the _commmon ratio_ to a different power (the exponent depends on what terms from the sequence we are considering). Conversely, the <portal cid=169>LCM</portal> is just the smallest of the number we are interested in.

## Geometric progression: What is a geometric sequence/progression?

Let's see now what is a geometric sequence in _layperson_ terms. A geometric sequences is a collection of specific numbers that are related by the common ratio we have mentioned before. The <portal cid=258>ratio</portal> is one of the defining features of a given sequences and together with the initial term of the sequence. We will see later how this two numbers are at the basis of the geometric sequence definition and depending on how they are used one can obtain the explicit formula for a geometric sequence or the equivalent recursive formula for the geometric sequence.

Now we will construct a simple geometric sequence using concrete values of this two defining parameters. To make things simple we will take the initial term to be `1` and the ratio will be set to `2`. In this case we have the first term been `a‚ÇÅ = 1` by definition; the second term would be `a‚ÇÇ = a‚ÇÅ * 2 = 2`, the third term would then be `a‚ÇÉ	= a‚ÇÇ * 2 = 4`... Etc. The _n-th_ term of the progression would then be 
`a‚Çô = 1 * 2‚Åø‚Åª¬π`
Where `n` would be the position of said term in the sequence.

A common way to write a geometric progression is to **explicitly write down the first terms**. This allows you to calculate any other number in the sequence; for our example we would write the series as:
`1, 2, 4, 8...`
However there are more mathematical ways to provide the same information. These other ways are the so-called explicit and recursive formula a for geometric sequence. Now that we understand perfectly what is a geometric sequence we can dive deeper into this formulas and explore the mathematical way of conveying the same meaning in less words and with more precision.

## Explicit formula of a geometric sequence vs recursive formula of a geometric sequence

There exists two distinct ways in which you can **mathematically represent a geometric sequence with just one formula**: the explicit formula for geometric sequence and the recursive formula for geometric sequence. The first one of the two is the one we have already seen in our geometric series example. What we saw was the specific explicit formula for our geometric series example but you can write a formula that is valid for any geometric progression. From this general formula one can substitute the values of `a‚Çô` for the corresponding initial term and `r` for the ratio. The general formula for the n-th term is: 
`a‚Çô = a‚ÇÅ * r‚Åø‚Åª¬π  n ‚àà ùó° `
The recursive formula for geometric sequence conveys the most important information about a geometric progression: the initial term `a‚ÇÅ`, how to obtain any term from the first one, and the fact that there is no term before the initial (`n ‚àà ùó° ` means that `n =1, 2, 3, ...`)

There is another way to show the same information, another type of formula: the recursive formula for geometric sequence. This formula is made of two parts that convey different parts of the geometric sequence definition. The first part explains how to get from any member of the sequence to any other member using the ratio. This meaning alone is not enough to construct a geometric sequence from scratch since we do not know the starting point. This is the **second part of the formula, the initial term** (or any other term for that matter). Let's see how this recursive formula looks:
`a‚Çô = a‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ * r`
`a·µ¢ = x`
Where here `x` is used to express the fact that any number will be used in its place, but that it must be a explicit number and not a formula. The subscript `i` indicates any natural number (just like `n`) but it's used instead of `n` to make it clear that `i` does not need to be the same number as `n`.

This geometric sequence calculator will help you to analyze a geometric sequence - that is, a sequence in which each term is constructed by multiplying the previous one by a constant factor. You will be able to find this factor, as well as any term of the sequence and the geometric series - sum of n consecutive terms. If the sequence has a sum to infinity, our geometric sum calculator will find it as well. If you want to know what rules and formulas does it use, simple keep reading! 

## Geometric progression: What is a geometric sequence/progression?

A geometric sequence is an ordered set of numbers, in which each consecutive number is found by multiplying the previous term by a factor called the **common ratio**. Just as in case of any other sequence, it can have a finite (for example 30) or an infinite number of terms. 

Geometric sequences are uniquely defined by two main coefficients: the **common ratio** and the **first term**. If you know these two values, you will be able to calculate each term of the sequence in a few seconds.

Some examples of a geometric sequence include:
* 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128...
* 6, -3, 1.5, -0.75, 0.375...
* 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1... (called the alternating sequence with `r = -1`)

## Explicit formula of a geometric sequence and the n·µó ∞ term

What happens if you want to calculate a certain term of a geometric sequence - for example, the tenth one? You surely don't want to keep multiplying the numbers over and over. You probably have already noticed that you don't have to. The only thing you need to do is to take the first term and multiply it by the common ratio raised to a certain power. When put into a formula, this rule looks like this:

`a‚Çô = a‚ÇÅ * r‚Åø‚Åª¬π`

where:
* *a** is the n·µó ∞ term of the sequence,
* **r** is the common ratio and
* **a‚ÇÅ** is the first term of the sequence.

## Geometric sequence formula and how to become a geometric sum calculator

Now, let's assume that you want to calculate the geometric series with our geometric sequence calculator (a series is simply a sum of the sequence). Do you need to calculate each and every term and finally add them together?

The answer is no. You can use a geometric sum equation that requires you to know only three things - the common ratio, the first term and number of terms you want to add up. This formula is derived using the properties of polynomial division.

`Œ£ = a‚ÇÅ * (1 - r‚Åø) / (1-r)`

## Geometric series formula: sum of a geometric sequence

You probably noticed that if the common ratio is lower than 1, each consecutive term is smaller than the previous one. That means that at some point the terms will become so small that they will virtually be equal to 0 and not have any influence on the series. Such sequences have an **infinite sum** - the sum of all terms, from the first one to infinity.

The necessary condition for a geometric sequence to have an infinite sum is that the absolute value of the common ratio must be lower than 1 (`|r| < 1`).

Then, you can find the infinite series according to the formula

`Œ£ = a‚ÇÅ / (1-r)`

## Other types of sequences

Our geometric sequence calculator is capable of analyzing only one specific type of a sequence. For example, the sequence 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15... does not have a common ratio, so its sum cannot be found using this tool. Feel free to check out our <portal cid="509">arithmetic sequence calculator</portal> if you want to solve that sequence.
