Introducing the **octagon calculator**, the ultimate tool for everything octagon. In this web page you will find a great tool for calculating the diagonals, perimeter, circumradius, inradius and area of a regular octagon. In this octagon area calculator you will also find all the information about what is an octagon, how many side does an octagon have or how to draw an octagon. We will review the octagon definition, explain the octagon angles and how they affect the octagon shape. On top of all that we see a few examples of real-world octagons including octagon tiles and flooring and the famous "Octagon house".

## Octagon definition: How many sides does an octagon have?

The standard definition of an octagon goes something similar to: "_An octagon is a polygon with **8 straigth sides delimiting a closed area**_". For anyone with **basic notions of Greek** this will be almost obvious and could answer the question _how many sides does an octagon have_ without any notions of Mathematics. That is because "_Octo-_" in Greek means eight, so it is safe to assume an **octagon has eight sides**, or that an octopus has eight legs.

We will dive a bit deeper on the Greek origin of the octagon shape when we talk about the octagon angles, but for now **let's stick to octagon sides** for now. If someone asks "how many sides does an octagon have?" the answer is always the same, but if they ask about the **length of those sides**, there is not one answer we can give. **An octagon can have sides of any length** an still be an octagon, there are no restrictions there. However when the **octagon has all side of the same length, it is called a regular octagon** and has special properties as we will see in the following sections.


## Octagon angles: What is an octagon?

If we look at the **origin of the word** "_Octagon_" it comes from the Greek for: "_eight angles_" meaning a polygon that is **composed of 8 angles joined by straight sides**. As a necessary consequence of have 8 angles, an octagon will always have 8 sides. In fact the standard octagon definition defines the octagon as have 8 sides rather than 8 angles, but we already know that **both definitions are virtually the same**. So the question _what is an octagon?_ is equally well answered by saying "a 8-sided polygon" as it is by the equivalent "a polygon with 8 angles".

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="LINK" alt="Octagon angles and properties" style="width:60%" align="center"> </p>

While the sides of an octagon can have any length, the octagon angles are restricted. There is **not restriction imposed on each of the angles**, but on the sum of all of them. This is a **geometrical restriction** since it would be impossible to join all 8 side together without following this rule. For all octagons the **sum of all its internal angles is always `1080º`**, whilst for the **external angles sum `360º` as it is the case for every polygon**.

This means that a **regular octagon** will have internal octagon angles of **exactly `1080º/8 = 135º**. A regular octagon is more than a pretty octagon shape, we'll see now how to get the area of an octagon and the **tricks that can be used with a regular octagon**.

## Area of an octagon: How to find the area of a regular octagon?

To find the area of a regular octagon by hand, the **easiest procedure is to apply the standard formula** for the <portal cid="1114">area of a regular polygon </portal>. The formula is the following: `Area = Perimeter * Apothem / 2`. Where the _Apothem_ is the **distance between the center of the polygon and the mid-point of a side**. The perimeter can be calculated by summing the length of each side, multiplying the length of one side times the number of sides, or, if you're feeling lazy, you can also use our <portal cid='1115'>perimeter of a polygon calculator</portal>.

A trick to remember this formula is to **understand where it comes from**. If we look at the apothem we can see that it's the <portal cid='1082'> height of a triangle </portal> made by taking a line from the vertices of the polygon/octagon to the centre of it. The resulting triangle is what is called an <portal cid='981'> Isosceles triangle</portal> and its area is `Area = Base * Height / 2` as we explained in the <portal cid='906'> triangle area calculator</portal>. Note that the `Base` of the triangle is the **length of the side of the octagon**. Since there are as many of these triangles as the polygon has sides (8 for an octagon), if we **multiply the area of the triangle by the number of sides** we obtain the total area of the octagon: `Area(octagon) = #sides * Base * Height / 2 = perimeter * apothem / 2`.

Apart from using triangles there are **other tricks we can use to calculate the area of an octagon** if we don't remember the formula. For example if we imagine an octagon shape inside of a square we can see that the difference is only 4 <portal cid='257'> right triangles</portal>. "How to find the area of a regular octagon with this information?" you might ask. **It is very easy**: 
1) Calculate the <portal cid='1085'> area of the square</portal> (the side is `2*apothem`)
1) Calculate the sides of the right triangles either using the <portal cid='1076'> 45 45 90 triangle calculator</portal> or the fact that they are **right isosceles triangles** and use the <portal cid='1078'>special right triangles calculator</portal>
1) Subtract the <portal cid='1100'>area of a right triangle</portal> four times from the area of the square
1) Enjoy the success!

Alternatively you can use **a trick**: if you organise the right triangles correctly you can construct a square from all 4 of them. In this case the side is **the hypotenuse which is also the side of the octagon**. Then you can calculate the <portal cid='933'>area of the parallelogram</portal> we just made from the 4 right triangles and **subtract it from the area of the big square**.

## Properties of a regular octagon

A regular octagon is a polygon with 8 equally long edges and 8 vertices. Each of the octagon's eight internal angles measures exactly 135°. In total, the octagon has 20 diagonals; the longest ones are simultaneously its symmetry axes and meet in a central point O, which is also the origin of symmetry.

You can imagine the regular octagon as a square with truncated corners. The sides of the large square are equal to `(1 + √2)a`, where `a` denotes the length of an octagon's edge. Thus, the area of the large square is equal to:

`S = [(1 + √2)a]² = (3 + 2√2)a²`

Then, you need to calculate the area of four small triangles and subtract it from the area of the large square. As you can see in the picture above, the area of four small triangles sums up to `a²`. Hence, the octagon area is equal to

`A = S - a² = (3 + 2√2)a² - a²`

`A = 2 *(1 + √2)a²`

## Calculating the perimeter

Determining the perimeter of a regular octagon is extremely easy. As it has eight edges of equal length, all you need to do is multiply the length of the side by 8:

`P = 8a`

If you don't know the perimeter, but know the octagon area, you can use the following formula to quickly find the perimeter:

`P = √ [32 * A / (1 + √2)]`

## Diagonals of a regular octagon

You can also use this octagon calculator to find the lengths of all of its diagonals. There are three different types of diagonals (take a look at the first image for reference):

* Short diagonals, for example AG, FH or CE;
* Medium diagonals, such as AF or BE (also called the height of an octagon); 
* Long diagonals, for example AE or BF.

You can derive the formula for each of them with ease, suing the basic principles of geometry. Here are the formulas for their length:

* Short diagonal `d = a * √(2 + √2)`
* Medium diagonal `e =  a * (1 + √2)`
* Long diagonal `f = a * √(4 + 2√2)`.

## Circumradius and inradius

To top it all off, our octagon area calculator is capable of finding the radii of a circumscribed and an inscribed circle. 

You can notice that the circumradius is simply the half of the length of the longest diagonal:

`R = f/2 = a / 2 * √(4 + 2√2)`

Similarly, the inradius is just the half of the octagon's height:

`r = e/2 = a/2 * (1 + √2)`
