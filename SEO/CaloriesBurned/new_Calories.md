If you're wondering how many calories did you burn while walking, dancing, playing football, or during any other physical activity, you should give this calories burned calculator a try. Basing on the activity type and duration, it estimates how many <portal cid="231">calories</portal> you burned and, consequently, how much weight you can expect to lose.

## What are calories?

Calories are simply a measure of energy. Traditionally it was a fairly common way of measuring energy, but nowadays it's been relegated to almost uniquely nutrition and energy content in food. The definition of a **calorie is the energy required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1C**. In modern times the definition of a calorie has been tuned and improved to a more reliable and repeatable one until we have arrived at the current: **1 calorie is equivalent to 4.18 joules**.

In nutrition, we actually deal with kilocalories (kcal), where 1 kcal is equal to a thousand  "small" calories. This kilocalorie is often called large calorie, Cal or Calorie (with capital 'C'). As you imagine, 1 kcal = 4.18 kJ. In this article, we use the term "calories" to describe kilocalories for simplicity.

When you talk about calories, people immediately think about nutrition, weight loss, and even health problems associated to being overweight, such as heart diseases. This is because <portal cid=292>body fat</portal> and calories are very closely related. Body fat is the way our body stores energy for times of necessity, that is, body fat is how we store the extra calories that we ate but never burned. 

There is a simple correlation between calories and fat, which is based on the energy density of body fat. Each kilogram of body fat stores about 7700 kcal. This equivalence is what allows the burned calories calculator to predict the weight loss derived from a certain exercise. However, this is just an oversimplification since calories in vs calories out is not the whole story of weight loss. We will go a bit more into details in a later section, for now let's focus on the calculator.

## How to calculate calories burned?

Since calories are effectively energy, any time energy is used or transformed in our body, we consume calories. This includes those times in which we are apparently doing "nothing" since, luckily for us, our body is still functioning and consuming energy. The energy is consumed in activities such as pumping blood through our system, processing food in our digestive system and even thinking. But when we talk about consuming calories we tend to think more about the conscious act of exercising and expending extra energy compared to the normal or basal metabolic levels.

As you could expect, every exercise needs different amounts of energy. Walking at a relaxed pace will surely burn fewer calories than running or fitness. This energy expenditure is typically expressed in `MET` - the **Metabolic Equivalent of a Task. This measure tells you how many calories you burn per hour of activity and per one kilogram of body weight**.

The MET value of an exercise is higher the more energy such activity requires. You can check that by looking at the different MET values of the exercises we have included in this calorie calculator. For example, sleeping has a value of 1 MET while running has a MET of 7.5, much higher

What exactly is 1 MET, then? It is defined as the ratio of energy spent per unit time during a specific physical activity to a reference value of 3.5 ml O₂/(kg·min). While the MET values allow us to compare activities, they don't measure energy directly, which means than some other steps need be taken before we can calculate the calorie consumption of a certain activity. Doing that requires some recalculation and converting millilitres of oxygen to calories before we arrive at the final formula:

`calories = T * 60 * MET * 3.5 * W / 200`

where **T** is the duration of activity in hours, and **W** is your weight in kilograms.

Our calorie burn calculator uses the formula above for the most accurate estimation of calories burned. If you want to run your calculations by hand, you can also use a simplified version of this equation:

`calories = MET * T * W`

This equation is based on the approximation saying that `1 MET = 1 kcal / (kg * h)`. It is not 100% correct since the real equivalence is `1 kcal/(kg * h) = 1.05 MET`, as you can check from the initial formula. Nevertheless, the approximation simplifies calculations so much that a mere 5% difference is an acceptable price to pay.


## How many calories did I burn while biking?

If you want to calculate the weight loss or calorie loss after a certain physical activity, make sure to follow the steps below.

1. Choose your activity and determine its MET value. For example, for biking MET = 8.
1. Input your weight into the calories burned calculator. Let's assume you weigh 90 kg.
1. Determine the duration of the activity. Let's say you went for a whole day trip and were biking for 7 hours straight. 
1. Input all of these values into the calorie burn formula:

`calories = T * 60 * MET * 3.5 * W / 200`

`calories = 7 * 60 * 8 * 3.5 * 85 / 200 = 4998 kcal`

5. Finally, divide this value by 7700 to obtain your weight loss:

`4988/7700 = 0.65 kg`

Congratulations! Your bike trip just helped you lose 0.65 kg. Now, it's about time to head to the <portal cid="81">BMI calculator</portal> and check where you place, just remember, it's not a race, just an indicator. You can also visit our <portal cid="199">BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) calculator</portal> which will tell you how many calories your body requires for its basic existence. It will be a reasonable basis for constructing a new diet plan.

## A deeper look at MET and the calorie calculator

Let's now step back a little bit and look at how MET is calculated and what it really means. MET is a metric that assigns a single value to a certain activity but, as anyone that has ran or cycled frequently knows, the same exercise can vary in intensity significantly depending on the effort. It is not the same to go for a leisure ride with your kid than racing a criterium, even if they both take the same time. 

This is an effect that the calculator does not take into account: intensity. It is for this reason that the _calories burned calculator_ needs to be understood as an approximation and not as a precise measurement. The MET we have encoded in this tool are just a guide based on averages and typical values for a typical person.

However, one can correct for this issue by simply customising the MET value directly. We do not recommend doing this unless you know what you are doing and are confident on the personalised value that you introduce. The important thing to remember is that the MET values are not the be-all-and-end-all and should be taken with caution as indicators. They, however, help you compare easily the calorie consumption expected from different exercises and activities.

## BMR or how many calories per day you burn without doing anything

Another aspect that people tend to forget when thinking about how to calculate calories burned per day is the **Basal Metabolic Rate or BMR**. BMR is a measurement of the minimal metabolic rate or calories burned by "just being alive". It is defined as the calorie burning rate of an animal at rest. We can see it also as the minimum consumption of calories per day possible.

This value is surprisingly high in most people taking upwards of 1000kcal and even over 300kcal for professional athletes. As you might have noticed, we have singled out athletes as having a much higher than normal BMR, and that's for a reason: BMR is not a fixed value, it can be affected and changed.

Using very simplistic examples we can take a look at ways and reasons as to how the BMR changes in a person. When we exercise a lot not only do we need more calories to compensate for the expenditure during our activity, but also we put our body into a more active rest state when the time comes to recover. Recover is the key word here since, at rest, our body not only has to keep functioning like any other person's but also has to recover from the exercise and rebuild energy stores and muscle tissue with the consequent increase in BMR.

On the other hand we can lower our BMR by having a very sedentary lifestyle, which we do not recommend. On top of that, calorie intake has a significant effect on the BMR of a person since when we restrict the calorie consumption significantly, our body goes into what is called "starvation mode". In this state the body sense a lack of food and adapts accordingly reducing the BMR as much as possible so that it can use those precious and scarce calories when you need to move or think. 

This last effect is particularly counter productive when trying to lose weight by reducing the food intake and it's the reason why many people can't seem to lose weight even when eating half as much as they did before. Starvation mode is also partly responsible for the rebound effect after finishing a dieting period. We do not recommend losing weight by reducing the calorie intake unless you have professional advice since it can lead to nutrient deficiency and all the associated health risks.

## Burn more calories with these exercises

So now the question is: _How do I burn more calories?_ The answer is, as always, it depends. There are two major ways to burn more calories depending on whether you are restricted by time or not. Assuming you don't have a time limit, the answer is as intuitive as it gets: exercise for longer. As you can see by using the calculator, the more time to dedicate the more calories we burn in total.

However, most of us are usually restricted by the time we have available to exercise after taking care of our priorities like work, family... In this case the answer is: exercise with more intensity. The harder you train, the more calories you will burn. Sprinting burns more calories than jogging... But how long can you sprint? If you're truly sprinting, you shouldn't be able to go on for more than a minute, tops.

And this is the reason HIIT is so trendy right now. HIIT or Hight Intensity Interval Training, is a way of structuring your exercises so that you can keep the intensity very high (as the name implies) but also exercise for long combined time. The trick is to introduce periods of rest between high intensity bursts. This method is by far the most efficient way to burn more calories and it's unbeatable in terms of calories per time exercising.

On top of the fact that you will consume a higher number of calories, HIIT has a second advantage. HIIT is a very efficient way to raise your BMR. During HIIT exercising we create micro-damage in our muscles (don't worry is all good) that the body later repairs building a stronger and bigger muscle. This is how we get fitter and stronger and it's a process in which the number of calories burned at "rest" is greatly increased compared to steady-state cardio exercises, not to mention compared to sedentary lifestyle.

HIIT comes in many forms, from taking any sport and breaking the activity into intervals of mixed high intensity and low intensity (active recovery) to even weight lifting and fitness. It might sound counter intuitive but the calories burned lifting weights can rival a full body exercise such as dancing when we take into account the total calories burned throughout the day. On top of that, and with proper nutrition, the calories burned lifting weights will also contribute to building more muscle and prevent heart diseases.

## Burn calories and prevent heart disease with fitness

You might be thinking (specially if you're of a younger age) that the purpose of exercising and burning calories is mostly weight loss and fitness benefits. However, there's much more to exercising than looks and records. It is recognised by every doctor that regular exercise is the second best thing you can do for your health after quitting smoking, and the very best thing if you're not a smoker. 

Amongst the benefits of exercising we can point to psychological well-being and increased happiness, as well as physical health benefits such as improved immune system, higher bone density and lowering the risk of heart diseases. If we had to point to the most important benefits it would definitely be the psychological aspect as not only will exercise and burning calories make you happier but it also decreases the suicide rates amongst all populations, very good effect you must agree.

Together with lowering the risks of committing suicide, the reduce risk of suffering a heart disease has to be on the top of the list as well. The improvements that exercise has on our cardiovascular system are very significant and with heart diseases being the [leading cause of death for both man and woman](https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm) it is not something to sniff at. 

But HIIT training and hardcore exercising "_it's not for me_" you might say. To you I say: **Don't fret! There's a solution**. Luckily for us our bodies are not very picky about the types of exercises that we do, so literally **anything is better than nothing**. Walking, dancing, recreational swimming... Anything that moves your body is a good way to start; so find something that you enjoy doing, and [do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0)!

## Does sex burn calories?

So what about sex? Does sex count as active time? Does sex burn calories and improve my health? We have good news, the answer is YES! As any action involving motion, sex burns calories. So it might be a good option for you if you want to increase the number of calories that you consume per day. The only problem might be finding a willing partner.

Before you go into a sex retreat to burn calories, let's take a look at how much sense that would make by looking at how many calories does sex burn. The reality is probably not simple since answering _How many calories does burn?_ accurately involves, once again, a big fat "depends". As with any activity, it depends on your weight, the time you spend doing the activity and the intensity which means that sex burns calories at different rates depending on what and how you do it.

Let's not get it cheek-blushing details and just take a look at a typical encounter. According to statistics, the [average sexual encounter lasts from seven minutes](https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/sex/a5943/average-sex-time-0709/) to a [maximum average reported of under twenty minutes](https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/how-long-does-sex-last-on-average) depending on the source. And we will also take the [average male weight in the USA](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/average-weight-american-men-15-pounds-20-years/story?id=41100782) (about 200lb), since its higher than women and therefore allows for a more generous estimation of how many calories sex burns.

Putting these values together into our calorie calculator we get a result of about 100kcal each time we have sex. Taking into account that most people are around a healthy <portal cid=>sex frequency</portal> of once every week, this figure fails to be significant for any weight loss purposes. It is still better than nothing, but knowing how many calories sex burns in reality, it doesn't seem like sex burns calories at a rate that would be significant; but maybe you and your partner can make it work for you.

## Let's get technical: Number of calories in food

Speaking of weight loss, which is the reason most of you would've landed in this calories burned calculator, let's turn our attention away from "how many calories did I burn?" and towards "how many calories per day do I consume?". For this purpose we have another calculator, but let's talk about dietary calories for a moment before we calculate anything.

not all calories are processes by intestines => dietary calorie
not all calories are equal
