If you're wondering how many calories did you burn while walking, dancing, playing football, or during any other physical activity, you should give this calories burned calculator a try. Basing on the activity type and duration, it estimates how many <portal cid="231">calories</portal> you burned and, consequently, how much weight you can expect to lose.

## What are calories?

Calories are simply a measure of energy you take in with your food. 1 calorie is equivalent to 4.18 joules.

In nutrition, we actually deal with kilocalories (kcal), where 1 kcal is equal to a thousand  "small" calories. As you could expect, 1 kcal = 4.18 kJ. (In this article, we use the term "calories" to describe kilocalories, what is quite a common practice.)

There are approximately 7700 calories stored in every kilogram of <portal cid="292">body fat</portal>. It means that losing 1 kg of body weight is equivalent to burning about 7700 calories. 

## How to calculate calories burned?

As you could expect, every activity needs a different energy expense. Walking at a relaxed pace will surely burn fewer calories than running or aerobics. This energy expenditure is typically expressed in **MET** - the Metabolic Equivalent of a Task. This measure tells you how many calories you burn per hour of activity and per one kilogram of body weight.

You can easily choose one of numerous activity types in our calories burned calculator. For example, walking has a MET value of 3.8, while hiking already 6. The higher this value is, the more energy the task demands. 

What exactly is 1 MET, then? It is defined as the ratio of energy spent per unit time during a specific physical activity to a reference value of 3.5 ml O₂/(kg·min). After some recalculation and converting milliliters of oxygen to calories, we arrive at the final formula:

`calories = T * 60 * MET * 3.5 * W / 200`

where **T** is the duration of activity in hours, and **W** is your weight in kilograms.

Our calorie burn calculator uses the formula above for the most accurate estimation of calories burned. If you want to run your calculations by hand, you can also use a simplified version of this equation:

`calories = MET * T * W`

This equation is based on the approximation saying that `1 MET = 1 kcal / (kg * h)`. It is not 100% correct; still, it provides a good enough result that can be used to estimate the calorie loss.

One kilogram of body fat contains about 7700 calories. It means that once you've found the number of burned calories, all you have to do is divide it by 7700 to obtain the weight loss in kilograms. 

## How many calories did I burn while biking?

If you want to calculate the weight loss or calorie loss after a certain physical activity, make sure to follow the steps below.

1. Choose your activity and determine its MET value. For example, for biking MET = 8.
2. Input your weight into the calories burned calculator. Let's assume you weigh 85 kg.
3. Determine the duration of the activity. Let's say you went for a whole day trip and were biking for 7 hours straight. 
4. Input all of these values into the calorie burn formula:

`calories = T * 60 * MET * 3.5 * W / 200`

`calories = 7 * 60 * 8 * 3.5 * 85 / 200 = 4998 kcal`

5. Finally, divide this value by 7700 to obtain your weight loss:

`4988/7700 = 0.65 kg`

Congratulations! Your bike trip just helped you lose 0.65 kg. Now, it's about time to head to the <portal cid="81">BMI calculator</portal> and check where you place, just remember, it's not a race, just an indicator. You can also visit our <portal cid="199">BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) calculator</portal> which will tell you how many calories your body requires for its basic existence. It will be a reasonable basis for constructing a new diet plan.
