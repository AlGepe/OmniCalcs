The right triangle calculator will help you find the length of the sides in a right angled triangle. This triangle solver will also help you find the area of a right triangle as well as give plenty of information about the practical uses of a right triangle.

## What is a right triangle (or right angled triangle)?

First things first, let's explain what a right triangle is. The definition is very simple and might even seem obvious for those who already know it: a right angled triangle is a triangle that has one angle with the exact value of 90º. The rest of the angles will clearly be smaller than the right angle because the sum of all angles in a triangle is always 180º

This right angle also allows to define the sides of a right triangle in a special way. The side opposing the right angle is always the biggest in the triangle and receives the name of hypotenuse. The other two sides are called cathetus. The relationship between the hypotenuse and the cathetus is a very simple one as we will see when we talk about Pythagoras' theorem 

## Hypotenuse calculator

If all one wants to calculate is the hypotenuse of a right triangle, this page and its right triangle calculator will work just fine. However we would recommend also to use the specific tool we have developed at Omni: <portal cid="1098">The hypotenuse calculator</portal>. This side is opposite the right angle and can be solved by using the Pythagorean theorem. In a right triangle with cathetus `a` and `b` with hypotenuse `c`, Pythagoras' theorem states that: `a² + b² = c²`. 

To solve for `c` take the <portal cid="151">square root</portal> of both sides to get `c = √b²-a²`. This extension of the Pythagorean theorem is not given the name "hypotenuse formula". The <portal cid="53">Pythagorean theorem calculator</portal> is also an excellent tool for calculating the hypotenuse.

Let's see now a practical example of what it would take to calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle without using any of the calculators available at Omni:

1. Obtain the values of `a` and `b`
1. Square `a` and `b`.
1. Sum up both values: `a² + b²`
1. Take the square root of the result. 
1. The square root will yield a positive and negative result. Since we are dealing with length, disregard the negative result.
1. The resulting value is the value of the hypotenuse `c`


Now let's see what the process would be using one of Omni's calculator, for example the right triangle calculator in this webpage:

1) Insert the value of `a` and `b` into the calculator
1) Obtain the value of `c` immediately
1) As a bonus you will get the value of the area for such a triangle.


## How to find the area of a right triangle

The method for finding the area of a right triangle is quite simple. All that is needed is the length of the base and the height. In a right triangle the base and the height are the two sides which form the right angle. The formula is `Area = (1/2)base * height`. If you don't know the base or the height, you can find it using the Pythagorean theorem. Use the right triangle calculator to check your calculations or calculate the area of triangles with sides that have larger or decimal value length.

## Other considerations when dealing with a right triangle

Notice the sides of a triangle have a certain degree of gradient or slope. We can use a <portal cid="184">slope calculator</portal> to determine the slope of each side. The formula for slope if you wish to calculate by hand is 

`(y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁)`

So if the coordinates are `(1,-6) and (4,8)`, the slope of the segment is `(8 + 6)/(4 - 1) = 14/3`.  An easy way to determine if the triangle is right just knowing the coordinates is to see if the slopes of any two lines multiply to equal `-1`

There is an easy way to convert angles from radians to degrees and degrees to radians with the use of the <portal cid="211">angle conversion</portal>.  

**If angle is in radians**
1. Multiply by `180/π`

**If angle is in degrees**
1. Multiply by `π/180`

<later>Sometimes you may encounter a problem where two or all three side lengths area missing. In such cases, the right triangle calculator, hypotenuse calculator and method on how to find the area of a right triangle won't help. You will use trigonometric functions to solve for these missing pieces. This can be accomplished by hand or by using a <portal cid="185">triangle calculator</portal>.</later>
