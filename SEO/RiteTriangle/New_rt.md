The right triangle calculator will help you find the length of the sides in a right angled triangle. This triangle solver will also help you find the area of a right triangle as well as give plenty of information about the practical uses of a right triangle.

## What is a right triangle (or right angled triangle)?

First things first, let's explain what a right triangle is. The definition is very simple and might even seem obvious for those who already know it: a right angled triangle is a triangle that has one angle with the exact value of 90º. The rest of the angles will clearly be smaller than the right angle because the sum of all angles in a triangle is always 180º

This right angle also allows to define the sides of a right triangle in a special way. The side opposing the right angle is always the biggest in the triangle and receives the name of hypotenuse. The other two sides are called cathetus. The relationship between the hypotenuse and the cathetus is a very simple one as we will see when we talk about Pythagoras' theorem 

## Hypotenuse calculator

If all one wants to calculate is the hypotenuse of a right triangle, this page and its right triangle calculator will work just fine. However we would recommend also to use the specific tool we have developed at Omni: <portal cid="1098">The hypotenuse calculator</portal>. This side is opposite the right angle and can be solved by using the Pythagorean theorem. In a right triangle with cathetus `a` and `b` with hypotenuse `c`, Pythagoras' theorem states that: `a² + b² = c²`. 

To solve for `c` take the <portal cid="151">square root</portal> of both sides to get `c = √b²-a²`. This extension of the Pythagorean theorem is not given the name "hypotenuse formula". The <portal cid="53">Pythagorean theorem calculator</portal> is also an excellent tool for calculating the hypotenuse.

Let's see now a practical example of what it would take to calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle without using any of the calculators available at Omni:

1. Obtain the values of `a` and `b`
1. Square `a` and `b`.
1. Sum up both values: `a² + b²`
1. Take the square root of the result. 
1. The square root will yield a positive and negative result. Since we are dealing with length, disregard the negative result.
1. The resulting value is the value of the hypotenuse `c`


Now let's see what the process would be using one of Omni's calculator, for example the right triangle calculator in this webpage:

1) Insert the value of `a` and `b` into the calculator
1) Obtain the value of `c` immediately
1) As a bonus you will get the value of the area for such a triangle.


## How to find the area of a right triangle

We have seen already that calculating the area of a right angle triangle is very easy when using the right triangle calculator. At Omni we have a calculator specifically designed for that purpose as well: <portal cid=1100> Area of a right triangle calculator</portal> and even one for the adventurous amongst you that would like to calculate the area of any triangle: <portal cid=906> area of a triangle calculator</portal>. Let's now see a bit more in-depth how to calculate areas of right triangles.

The method for finding the area of a right triangle is quite simple. All that is needed is the length of the base and the height. In a right triangle the base and the height are the two sides which form the right angle. The formula is `Area = (1/2)base * height`. If you don't know the base or the height, you can find it using the Pythagorean theorem. Use the right triangle calculator to check your calculations or calculate the area of triangles with sides that have larger or decimal value length.

## Other considerations when dealing with a right triangle

Now we're gonna see other stuff that can be calculated from a right triangle using some of the tools available at Omni. The sides of a triangle have a certain gradient or slope. We can use a <portal cid="184">slope calculator</portal> to determine the slope of each side. The formula for the slope (in case you want to calculate by hand) is 

`(y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁)`

So if the coordinates are `(1,-6) and (4,8)`, the slope of the segment is `(8 + 6)/(4 - 1) = 14/3`.  An easy way to determine if the triangle is right just knowing the coordinates is to see if the slopes of any two lines multiply to equal `-1`

There is an easy way to convert angles from radians to degrees and degrees to radians with the use of the <portal cid="211">angle conversion</portal>.  

**If angle is in radians**
1. Multiply by `180/π`

**If angle is in degrees**
1. Multiply by `π/180`

## Special triangles

The right triangle is just one of the many special triangles that exist. These triangles have one or several special characteristics that make them unique. For example, as we have seen, the right triangle has a right angle a hence the hypotenuse that make it a unique kind of triangle. Aside from the right angled triangle there are other special triangles with interesting properties.

One of the most known special triangles is the equilateral triangle, which has all side of equal length and all its angles are 60º ones. This makes it much more simple to make a triangle solver calculator such as the <portal cid=983>equilateral triangle calculator</portal> in which one can calculate different parameters of such triangle.

Another of special triangles is the isosceles triangle, which has 2 of the sides of equal length, and hence also two angles of the same size. As opposed to the equilateral triangle, the isosceles triangles come in many different shapes, but all have certain properties that are exploited by the <portal cid=981>isosceles triangle calculator</portal> to obtain all the parameters of said triangles.

There are many other special triangles that we do not have time to talk abut in this right angle calculator. However we will take a look at a few special right triangles that on top of being right angled triangles the have other special properties that make them interesting.

## Special right triangles

Of all the special right triangles, probably the most special of them all is the so called "45 45 90" triangle. This is a right angled triangle that is also an isosceles triangle. Both its cathetus are of the same length (isosceles) and has also the peculiarity that the non-right angles are exactly have the size of the right angle that give the name to the right triangle. 

This right triangle is the kind of triangle that one obtains when one divides a square by its diagonal, which is why both cathetus (sides of the square) are of equal length. For those interested in knowing more about the most special of the special right triangles we recommend checking out the <portal cid=1076> 45 45 90 triangle calculator</portal> made for this purpose.

Another very interesting triangle from the group of special right triangles is the so-called "30 60 90" triangle. The name comes from having one right angle (90º)and then one angle of 30º and another of 60º. This angles are special because of the values of their trigonometric functions (cosine, sine, tangent...). The consequences of this can be seeing and understood in the <portal cid=1077>30 60 90 triangle calculator </portal> but for those too lazy to click the link we will summarise some of them here. Assuming that the shorter side is of length `a` the triangle follows:

1) the second leg is equal to `a√3`
1) the hypotenuse is `2a`
1) the area is equal to `a²√3/2`
1) the perimeter equals `a(3 + √3)`

## Right angled triangles and parallelograms

It might seem at first sights that a right triangle and a parallelogram do not have anything in common. How can a triangle solver help with understanding a parallelogram? The reality is that any parallelogram can be decomposed in 2 or more right triangles. Let's take the example of the rectangle which is the easiest one to see it. 

Imagine a rectangle, any rectangle; now imagine to trace one of the diagonals of this rectangle (you can learn more about this on the <portal cid=1094>diagonal of a rectangle calculator</portal>). If we take a look now and separate the rectangle by the diagonal what we obtain is two right angled triangles. Looking at the triangles there is no need to use the right triangle calculator to see that both are equal, so their areas will be the same. This means that the area of the rectangle is double that of each of the rectangles.

If we think about the equations it makes all the sense since the <portal cid=749>area of a rectangle</portal> of sides `a` and `b` is exactly: `area = a * b` whilst for the right triangle is: `area = base * height / 2` which in this case would mean `area = a * b /2` which is exactly what we already saw by just cutting the rectangle by the diagonal.

This was the simple example of a rectangle, but the same is applicable to the <portal cid=1085>area of a square</portal> in exactly the same way. For other parallelograms the process becomes a bit more complicated (it might involve up to 4 right triangles of different size) but with a bit of skill one can use the same idea and calculate the <portal cid=933>area of a parallelogram</portal> using right angled triangles, or you can be more efficient even and just use our calculator.

## Shadows and right triangles (radius of the Earth)

We have talked a lot about triangles, in particular right triangles, and their applications in maths and geometry. What we haven't talk about yet is the usefulness of the right triangles for calculating things in real life. It might seem like the applications outside of geometry are limited but let's look at shadows.

Yes, shadows; the dark shade projected by an object when it is illuminated. If we were to look at the shape made by the shadow, the object and the ground... it is a right angled triangle!! At least it is when the object is perfectly vertical and so is the ground. But most of the times this is the case, or at least close enough. This means we can use the right triangle calculator to find different things abut objects in the sun, let's see how.

Imagine that we have a building of which we want to know the height, but be cannot measure it directly because it's too high to drop a measuring tape from the top. What one can do is measure the length of the shadow in the street and then with the help of any angle measuring tool and a piece of paper we can find out the angle between the shadow and the ground. Knowing that the angle between the building and the ground is 90º, we can input these data values into the <portal cid=1101>Right triangle side and angle calculator</portal> and obtain the value of the height of the building.

Using this technique we can measure the height of many objects as long as we have a bright sunny day or other means of illuminating the subject. In act this use to be a very common measuring technique in the olden days. Probably the most interesting and mind-blowing use of right triangles in history is that of Eratosthenes. He manage to use right angled triangles and shadows to measure the radius of the Earth, and now we are gonna explain how. 

Eratosthenes noticed that on the summer solstice there was a place on Earth where the wells did not have shadow at midday, i.e.: the sun shined straight down them. Noting this he set up a column of a known height at a known distance from that well and measured the size of the shadow at the same time of the day, the same day of the year. Then using right angled triangles and trigonometry he was able to measure the angle between the two cities and also the radius of the Earth.

Quite an astonishing feat that now you can do much more easily by just using the necessary Omni calculators that we have created for you. 

<later>Sometimes you may encounter a problem where two or all three side lengths area missing. In such cases, the right triangle calculator, hypotenuse calculator and method on how to find the area of a right triangle won't help. You will use trigonometric functions to solve for these missing pieces. This can be accomplished by hand or by using a <portal cid="185">triangle calculator</portal>.</later>
