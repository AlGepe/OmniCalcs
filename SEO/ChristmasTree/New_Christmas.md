Welcome to the Christmas tree decorations calculator, where you will find how to decorate a Christmas tree in the best way. Let's explore together the way to put the, hopefully, LED Christmas tree lights and predict how many you will actually need. We will talk about the first Christmas tree history, how would the best Christmas tree with lights be and answer the age old debate of whether Christmas tree ribbons are superior or not to lights as Christmas decorations.

## Oh Christmas tree! The ultimate of Christmas decorations

Christmas is upon us, much closer than you might think, but still further than advertisements want you to think. The real conclusion if you look at <portal cid=1212>how many days remain until Christmas</portal> is that is we should start getting ready for it. One of the things you will probably want to set up is your Christmas tree. And no Christmas tree is complete without Christmas tree ribbons or lights. Which bring an important question: How many Christmas tree lights do you need to decorate your tree properly?

The term "properly" is a subjective one but assuming you already have a perfect way the tree should look like, how do you know the length of lights you will need to fully decorate your Christmas tree? We have the solution. In the following sections we will show you how to wrap a Christmas tree in the most efficient and aesthetic way. How? -you might ask- How to decorate a Christmas tree the perfect way? It's easy, we will just need maths and a bit of ingenuity. 

There are many subjective things to take into consideration when deciding how to decorate a Christmas tree. Whether you prefer Christmas tree ribbons or light, what colors to use, how bright (brightness is measured in <portal cid=739>lumen</portal>) you want it to be, how much <portal cid=20>electricity cost</portal> are you willing to assume, and even where you want your Christmas tree (indoor or outdoor Christmas tree). However, there are certain aesthetic factors that will please most people such as uniformity, symmetry, proportionality... And those are the kinds of things that we can help you with in our Christmas tree decorations calculator.

## What makes the best Christmas tree?

Now that we know what we have to look at, let's do it.



## How to decorate a Christmas tree with lights [Theory]

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

But Christmas tree decorations, Christmas tree farms and all that surrounds this symbol of Christmas time, was not always as prevalent as we think. In fact the Christmas tree history is a very interesting one as we will explain now. Spoiler alert: the first Christmas tree probably appeared much later than you think.
## =How to use the calculator

Now that we know how the Christmas tree decorations calculator works internally, we can see how to use it for our purposes. To begin the explanation let us explain what each of the fields is referring to.

#### Simple mode variables:

* `Height`: Vertical distance from the tip of the tree to the end of the foliage
* `Bottom diameter`: diameter of the tree and the lowest part of the foliage
* `Strang length`: Length of the Christmas tree ribbon or LED Christmas tree lights, to decorate the tree.
* `Rotations`: How many time the chosen decoration will go around the Christmas tree
* `Spacing`: Distance between one rotation of the Christmas tree decoration and the next one.
* `Baubles density`: Measures how much of the tree will be covered by baubles
* `Number of baubles`: The number of baubles available or required to achieved such tree coverage
* `Tree coverage`: Percentage of the surface of the Christmas tree that will be covered by baubles.

#### Advanced mode variables:

* [Christmas tree] `Area`: Total area of the 'cone-like' representations of the tree
* [Bauble] `Spacing`: Number of baubles per unit of area (similar `baubles density`)

The Christmas tree decorations calculator has 3 sections. The first section is dedicated to calculate the area of the Christmas tree that we want to decorate. The second and third sections are dedicated to the actual Christmas decorations themselves with **2 options: lights (or ribbons) and baubles**

For both the Christmas tree area and the baubles sections you will need to provide 2 inputs in each sections while for the Christmas tree ribbon / lights section you only need to provide one. We have discussed previously how to decorate a Christmas tree in the most effective and harmonious way, so that is how the calculator assumes you will do it.

## You calculated everything, now what?

Now that you have figured out how many lights you need, you just need to consider the <portal cid=193>electricity cost</portal> to decide how long you want to keep them on. Alternatively you can buy better <portal cid=676> efficiency</portal> LED Christmas tree lights and run them for longer or save money. 

Another option is to build your own set of Christmas tree lights. If you embark in such a DIY project you can probably make us of some of our electrical calculators such as the <portal cid=550>voltage drop calculator</portal><portal cid=775>RC circuit calculator</portal><portal cid=1009>wire resistance calculator</portal> as a starting point. 

If you also plan to use LED lights, congratulations because you will have lower <portal cid=1052>electrical power consumption</portal> with all the benefits associated to it. However LEDs are complex diodes that don't follow <portal cid=178>Ohm's law</portal>. So if you want to truly understand them we recommend checking our <portal cid=1063>ideal diode calculator</portal><portal cid=216>LED resistor calculator</portal>.

## Mini Christmas tree history: the first Christmas tree

In a culture greatly influenced by Christian traditions, like the western culture is, the thought of a Christmas tree makes some people uncomfortable. A Christmas tree is thought of by some as a pagan symbol that is opposed to their religious believes, but is it really a pagan symbol? Let's talk a little bit about the Christmas tree history. Despite the widespread thought that Christmas trees are specifically mentioned in the Bible as a form of sacrilege, it is very unlikely that Christmas trees existed at that time. 

Even though evergreen branches were used since longer than recorded history as a decoration, the first real Christmas tree seem to have appeared in 1510 in Riga. This is first Christmas tree was located in the main square of the Estonian capital as Christmas decoration and burnt after the holidays. The first Christmas tree was not the start of a widespread tradition but something more anecdotal. History points towards germany as the next important milestone in widespread Christmas tree adoption. Proestant founder Martin Luther used them as Christmas decorations.

From there it would seem like adoption started growing as german settlers in Pennsylvania started using real Christmas trees as part of the decoration, and using candles as Christmas tree lights. Most of the concerns about pagan symbolism started to disappear as the royal family was drawn celebrating Christmas with a mini Christmas tree as decoration. From them the usage of Christmas trees and Christmas tree ornaments grew (apparently spreading from east to west) in the USA until it became one of the key symbols of Christmas.

Still today there are concerns about the (pagan) symbolism of a real Christmas tree but most of the people embrace this tradition and have their Christmas tree home. It is very hard nowadays to imagine Christmas decorations without thinking of a Christmas tree with all its Christmas ornaments.


## Choosing Christmas tree decorations: LED Christmas tree lights vs Christmas tree ribbons

Nobody should be discriminated for their color, and neither should Christmas decorations. Moreover it is not a calculator's job to pass judgement on what type of Christmas tree decorations are superior. That is why we built this Christmas tree decorations calculator on purpose so that it would be "_decoration-type_ agnostic". There are people who prefer to have LED Christmas tree lights because they produce more light and create a holiday-like atmosphere in the room; others, however, prefer the understated and unobtrusive look of Christmas tree ribbons.

So whether you are in love with LED Christmas tree lights or you swear by Christmas tree ribbons, we have you covered. The calculator will provide you with a result, no matter what type of decoration you want to use. As long as you are wrapping the Christmas lights/ribbons in the conical helix shape we have discussed above, you will be fine and our calculations will give you useful results. 

Just remember: all Christmas decorations are equal and have their places, you should not judge people for choosing one over the other, just respect. Tolerance is the key to a good healthy relationship so if you see someone using Christmas tree ribbons instead of LED lights, just tell them that they are not alone XXXXXXXXXXXXXXyou love them anyway and that you will help them XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
