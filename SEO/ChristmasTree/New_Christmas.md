Ho ho ho! Christmas is just around the corner! Every town becomes more and more colorful, brilliant lights and beautiful ornaments decorate buildings. And finally, huge Christmas trees, probably the most recognizable sign of Christmas, arise on the big squares in the city centers. This is a perfect time to bring Christmas Trees to our homes too! Let's explore together the way to put the Christmas tree ornaments and predict **how many you will actually need**. Believe or not, but it has been already calculated by the maths professor and our physicists team improved it even more.

The calculator on the left guides you step-by-step with real time computation and with visualization at the same time. If you're still not sure about it, keep reading the article below for some examples and ideas. We've also written about the Christmas tree history - why do we bring them and decorate in our homes? At the end, you will find an answer of the age-old debate of whether Christmas tree ribbons are superior or not to lights as Christmas decorations. And if you're from U.S. wondering whether there are any chances of snow this year, check out our <portal cid="1243">White Christmas</portal> calculator!

## How to use the calculator

Now that we know how the Christmas tree decorations calculator works internally, we can see **how to use it for our purposes**. To begin the explanation let us explain what each of the fields is referring to.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src ="https://uploads-cdn.omnicalculator.com/images/ChristmassTreeLights/christmasTree1.png" style="width:50%" align="center"></p>

**Simple mode variables:**

* `Height`: Vertical distance from the tip of the tree to the end of the foliage
* `Bottom diameter`: diameter of the tree and the lowest part of the foliage
* `Strang length`: Length of the Christmas tree ribbon or LED Christmas tree lights, to decorate the tree.
* `Rotations`: How many time the chosen decoration will go around the Christmas tree
* `Spacing`: Distance between one rotation of the Christmas tree decoration and the next one.
* `Baubles density`: Measures how much of the tree will be covered by baubles
* `Number of baubles`: The number of baubles available or required to achieve such tree coverage
* `Tree coverage`: Percentage of the surface of the Christmas tree that will be covered by baubles.

**Advanced mode variables:**

* [Christmas tree] `Area`: Total area of the 'cone-like' representations of the tree
* [Bauble] `Spacing`: Number of baubles per unit of area (similar `baubles density`)

The Christmas tree decorations calculator has 3 sections. The first section is dedicated to calculating the area of the Christmas tree that we want to decorate. The second and third sections are devoted to the actual Christmas decorations themselves with **2 options: lights (or ribbons) and baubles**

For both the Christmas tree area and the baubles sections you will need to **provide 2 inputs in each section** while for the Christmas tree ribbon/lights section you only need to provide one. We have discussed previously how to decorate a Christmas tree in the **most effective and harmonious way**, so that is how the calculator assumes you will do it.

The Christmas tree decorations calculator will show a simulated image of how the tree would look like with either the lights/ribbons or the baubles. The pictures will give you a good idea of how the Christmas tree would look like using the parameters you have input.

But Christmas tree decorations and all that surrounds this symbol of Christmas time were not as popular in the past as we think. In fact, **the Christmas tree history is a fascinating one** as we will explain now. Spoiler alert: the first Christmas tree probably appeared much later than you think.

## How to decorate a Christmas tree: Professor Troy Henderson's method

We decorate Christmas trees in almost every house, usually without any preparations. Now, let's do it mathematically! To find the perfect Christmas tree decorations, we need to take into account symmetry and uniformity. Using <a href="https://umobile.edu/learning/life-hack-perfectly-light-your-christmas-tree/">Dr. Troy Henderson's method</a>, we can predict the <portal cid=208>length</portal> of Christmas tree decorations, lights or ribbons that we need to achieve our desired level of "tree coverage". Using maths we can also calculate the number of Christmas baubles we need for our tree. Let us show you how to do it.

At first, you have to decide how do you want to wrap the light or ribbons around the tree. You don't to think about it very much! We know the answer. The best option is the mathematical shape called: **_Conical Helix_**. To understand this curve, aside from looking at the picture below, imagine a helix wrapped around a cone so that as it goes up, it gets narrower and narrower. Since we can all agree that a typical Christmas tree looks very similar to a cone, you can see how this shape is an **excellent way** to put your Christmas tree decorations.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src ="https://uploads-cdn.omnicalculator.com/images/ChristmassTreeLights/Al_ChristCHelix.png" style="width:60%" align="center"></p>

The conical helix gives us **excellent uniformity** when seen from the side or from the top. Not that many people look at Christmas trees from this side, but it's good to have all the bases covered. Moreover, it has almost rotational symmetry so that it does not matter where you start wrapping the Christmas tree or if you turn it around. With this in mind, the next step is to explore the **mathematical equations that define such a shape**. Those are not as complicated as one might think! Let's introduce them in the 3D coordinates (x, y, z):


`x(t) = r * (1-t) * cos(wt)`,

`y(t) = r * (1-t) * sin(wt)`,

`z(t) = h * t`,

where `t` is a parameter such that `0 ≤ t ≤ 1`, `r` is the starting radius (which for us is the diameter at the base of the tree) ,and the `w`  tells us (indirectly) how many times will ribbon rotate around the cone. To calculate the length of the lights, we can use the following integral. This is probably the most complicated operation in whole calculations, because we need to take an integral of a <portal cid=151>square root</portal>:

`length = ₀∫¹√[x(t)² + y(t)² + z(t)²]dt`.

With a very basic understanding of integration, you could solve it by hand. You don't need to do it, though, because we have created for you this easy calculator to do all the dirty work for you. 

But we did not limit the calculator to Dr. Troy Henderson's idea to model the tree lights, we also included **extra functionality**. The calculator can not only determine the length needed to adequately cover the tree, but also the amount of Christmas baubles that you will need to use to decorate the tree. For this second calculation, there are no fancy maths required. The calculator will first compute the <portal cid=475>surface area</portal> of the cone formed by the Christmas tree. With this value and your desired density of baubles, the calculator will obtain the necessary number of baubles as well as tell you what <portal cid=404>percentage</portal> of the surface of the tree will be covered by this bubbly Christmas decorations. 

With those informations **you can now plan** how many baubles do you need to prepare and how long should your lights and ribbons be!

## Oh Christmas tree! The ultimate of Christmas decorations

Christmas is upon us, much closer than you might think, but still **further than advertisements want you to believe**. The real conclusion if you look at <portal cid=1212>how many days remain until Christmas</portal> is that is we should start getting ready for it. One of the things you will probably want to set up is your Christmas tree. And no Christmas tree is complete without Christmas tree ribbons or lights. Which bring up an important question: **How many Christmas tree lights do you need to decorate your tree properly?**

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src ="https://uploads-cdn.omnicalculator.com/images/ChristmassTreeLights/WH.jpg" style="width:90%" align="center"></p>

The term "properly" is a subjective one but assuming you already have a perfect way the tree should look like, how do you know the length of lights you will need to decorate your Christmas tree? We have the solution. In the following sections, we will **show you how to wrap a Christmas tree most efficiently** and aesthetically. How? - You might ask- How to decorate a Christmas tree the perfect way? It's easy, we will just need **maths and a bit of ingenuity**. 

There are many subjective things to take into consideration when deciding how to decorate a Christmas tree. Whether you prefer Christmas tree ribbons or light, what colors to use, how bright (brightness is measured in <portal cid=739>lumen</portal>) you want it to be, how much <portal cid=20>electricity cost</portal> are you willing to assume, and even where you want your Christmas tree (indoor or outdoor Christmas tree). However, **certain aesthetic factors will please most people** such as uniformity, symmetry, proportionality... And those are the kinds of things that we can help you with, in our Christmas tree decorations calculator.


## Mini Christmas tree history: the first Christmas tree

In a culture greatly influenced by Christian traditions, like the western culture is, **the thought of a Christmas tree makes some people uncomfortable**. A Christmas tree is thought of by some as a pagan symbol that is opposed to their religious believes, but is it really a pagan symbol? Despite the popular thought that Christmas trees are specifically mentioned in the Bible as a form of heresy, it is **very unlikely that Christmas trees existed at that time**.

Even though evergreen branches were used since longer than recorded history as a decoration, **the first real Christmas tree seems to have appeared in 1510 in Riga**. This is first Christmas tree was located in the main square of the Latvia capital as Christmas decoration and burnt after the holidays. The first Christmas tree was not the start of a widespread tradition but something more anecdotal. History points towards Germany as the next important milestone in widespread Christmas tree adoption. **Protestant founder Martin Luther used them as Christmas decorations**.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src ="https://uploads-cdn.omnicalculator.com/images/ChristmassTreeLights/Christmas_Tree_1848.jpg" style="width:60%" align="center"></p>


From there it seems like adoption started growing as **German settlers in Pennsylvania started using Christmas trees** as part of the decoration, and using candles as Christmas tree lights. Most of the concerns about pagan symbolism began to disappear as the royal family was drawn celebrating Christmas with a mini Christmas tree as decoration. Since that moment, the usage of Christmas trees and Christmas tree ornaments grew (apparently spreading from east to west) in the USA until it **became one of the key symbols of Christmas**.

Still today there are concerns about the (pagan) symbolism of a real Christmas tree, but **most of the people embrace this tradition and have their Christmas tree home**. It is tough nowadays to imagine Christmas decorations without thinking of a Christmas tree with all its Christmas ornaments.


## Choosing Christmas tree decorations: LED Christmas tree lights vs Christmas tree ribbons

No person should ever be discriminated for their color, shape, looks... And neither should Christmas decorations. Moreover, **it is not a calculator's job to pass judgment** on what type of Christmas tree decorations are superior. That is why we built this Christmas tree decorations calculator on purpose so that it would be "_decoration-type_ agnostic". Some people **prefer to have LED Christmas tree lights** because they produce more light and create a holiday-like atmosphere in the room; others, however, prefer the **understated and unobtrusive look of Christmas tree ribbons**.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src ="https://uploads-cdn.omnicalculator.com/images/ChristmassTreeLights/Decoration_tree.JPG" style="width:60%" align="center"></p>

So whether you are in love with LED Christmas tree lights or you swear by Christmas tree ribbons, we have you covered. The calculator will **provide you with a result, no matter what type of decoration you want to use**. As long as you are wrapping the Christmas lights/ribbons in the conical helix shape we have discussed above, you will be fine, and our calculations will give you useful results. 

Just remember: all Christmas decorations are equal and have their places, **you should not judge people** for choosing one over the other, just respect. **Tolerance is the key** to a good healthy relationship so if you see someone using Christmas tree ribbons instead of LED lights, just tell them that they are not alone, that you love them anyway and that you will help them get their life back together **;)**

## You calculated everything, now what?

Now that you have figured out how many lights you need, you just need to consider the <portal cid=193>electricity cost</portal> to decide how long you want to keep them on. Alternatively, you can buy better <portal cid=676> efficiency</portal> LED Christmas tree lights and run them for longer or save money. 

Another option is to build your own set of Christmas tree lights. If you embark in such a DIY project you can probably make use of some of our electrical calculators such as the <portal cid=550>voltage drop calculator</portal><portal cid=775>RC circuit calculator</portal><portal cid=1009>wire resistance calculator</portal> as a starting point. 

If you also plan to use LED lights, congratulations because you will have lower <portal cid=1052>electrical power consumption</portal> with all the benefits associated to it. However LEDs are complex diodes that don't follow <portal cid=178>Ohm's law</portal>. So if you want to truly understand them we recommend checking our <portal cid=1063>ideal diode calculator</portal><portal cid=216>LED resistor calculator</portal>.
