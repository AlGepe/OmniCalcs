But Christmas tree decorations, Christmas tree farms and all that surrounds this symbol of christmas time, was not always as prevalent as we think. In fact the Christmas tree history is a very interesting one as we will explain now. Spoiler alert: the first Christmas tree probably appeared much later than you think.

## Mini Christmas tree history: the first Christmas tree

In a culture greatly influenced by Christian traditions, like the western culture is, the thought of a Christmas tree makes some people uncomfortable. A Christmas tree is thought of by some as a pagan symbol that is opposed to their religious believes, but is it really a pagan symbol? Let's talk a little bit about the Christmas tree history. Despite the widespread thought that christmas trees are specifically mentioned in the Bible as a form of sacrilege, it is very unlikely that Christmas trees existed at that time. 

Even though evergreen branches were used since longer than recorded history as a decoration, the first real christmas tree seem to have appeared in 1510 in Riga. This is first Christmas tree was located in the main square of the Estonian capital as Christmas decoration and burnt after the holidays. The first christmas tree was not the start of a widespread tradition but something more anecdotal. History points towards germany as the next important milestone in widespread christmas tree adoption. Proestant founder Martin Luther used them as Christmas decorations.

From there it would seem like adoption started growing as german settlers in Pennsylvania started using real Christmas trees as part of the decoration, and using candles as christmas tree lights. Most of the concerns about pagan symbolism started to disappear as the royal family was drawn celebrating christmas with a mini christmas tree as decoration. From them the usage of christmas trees and christmas tree ornaments grew (apparently spreading from east to west) in the USA until it became one of the key symbols of christmas.

Still today there are concerns about the (pagan) symbolism of a real christmas tree but most of the people embrace this tradition and have their Christmas tree home. It is very hard nowadays to imagine Christmas decorations without thinking of a Christmas tree with all its Christmas ornaments.


## Choosing Christmas tree decorations: LED Christmas tree lights vs Christmas tree ribbons

Nobody should be discriminated for their color, and neither should christmas decorations. Moreover it is not a calculator's job to pass judgement on what type of christmas tree decorations are superior. That is why we built this Christmas tree decorations calculator on purpose so that it would be "_decoration-type_ agnostic". There are people who prefer to have LED Christmas tree lights because they produce more light and create a holiday-like atmosphere in the room; others, however, prefer the understated and unobtrusive look of Christmas tree ribbons.

So whether you are in love with LED Christmas tree lights or you swear by Christmas tree ribbons, we have you covered. The calculator will provide you with a result, no matter what type of decoration you want to use. As long as you are wrapping the christmas lights/ribbons in the conical helix shape we have discussed above, you will be fine and our calculations will give you useful results. 

Just remember: all Christmas decorations are equal and have their places, you should not judge people for choosing one over the other, just respect. Tolerance is the key to a good healthy relationship so if you see someone using christmas tree ribbons instead of LED lights, just tell them that they are not alone XXXXXXXXXXXXXXyou love them anyway and that you will help them XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
