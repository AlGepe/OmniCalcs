Welcome to the factorial calculator: a tool that calculates the factorial of any integer from 0 to a 170. On top of calculating the 0-factorial, 5-factorial... And any other factorial, we will also provide information about the n-factorial formula and the applications it can have. We will answer the question of "what is a factorial?" using the factorial definition, and we will dive into the maths behind it to find how we can include more than just positive integers. 

## Exclamation point in Maths: What is a factorial?

 <-- WAT IMAGE-->

 When you see for the first time an exclamation point in maths you probably got shocked or even thought you that there was some kind of mistake or typo. But the reality is different: this exclamation point in maths is called the factorial or n-factorial. The factorial is a fairly unknown operator, that in reality can be viewed more as an abbreviation than a true operator in itself, at least at the beginning.

It is important not to confuse the factorial with <portal cid=143>prime factorization</portal> which is a way of obtaining the prime numbers that when multiply give you a known number. Prime factorization has its uses in maths and is arguably more known than the n-factorial. Part of the reason prime factorization is more popular is its usefulness when calculating <portal cid=169>Greatest Common Factor</portal> and the <portal cid=170>Least Common Multiplier</portal>, but we are digressing now.

To understand what the factorial does or means we should start with an example. We could chose any number `n` and calculate its n-factorial value but the best is to choose a fairly small number, so let's use 5-factorial.

`5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`

From this example you can get and intuition of what is a factorial and even take a guess at the factorial formula. You can also understand why this exclamation point in maths can be regarded as an abbreviation, since it is not a new operation but rather a collection of multiplications. In short and rather informally we can define the factorial as the multiplications of all the positive integers equal of smaller than the given number. 

Playing a bit with this we can see that for 5-factorial we can relate it to 4-factorial in a very simple way:

`5! = 5 * (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 5 * 4!`

This kind of relationships between n-factorials with different `n` is the basis of the mathematical formula that defines the factorial operation, as we will see in the next section.

The factorial operation is not used everywhere in maths but it is very important in statistics and probability problems. In those cases, specially when one has to deal with <portal cid=427> permutation calculators </portal> or combinatorics, the n-factorial appears almost all the time. We will see real world examples of problems that require the usage of factorials and the factorial formula.

## Getting mathematical: Factorial definition and Factorial formula

So far we have seen a rather loose explanation of what is a factorial but we have not given a proper factorial definition. Well, that is precisely the aim of this section: to see and explain the factorial formula and how we can infer from it the factorial definition in a more mathematical way. 

For a more mathematical description of the factorial formula let's look at the n-factorial and how that would relate to other factorials. In this case `n` can be any number. If we look at the previous examples with 5-factorial, we can see that 

`5! = 5 * 4! = 5 * (5-1)!`

If we now extrapolate that to the n-factorial:

`n! = n * (n-1)!`

Which is the general factorial formula and is an integral part of the factorial definition. However this does not answer all the questions about factorials. For example, what would happen if we take a negative number? When do I stop subtracting numbers? These are valid questions that the factorial formula we have shown doesn't answer but are fundamental for having a proper factorial definition.

These two questions can be answered easily by stating that the factorial formula is **only defined for positive integers**, which means that we cannot go lower than `n = 1`. But this also brings up another question: What is the 0-factorial? Since we cannot use this formula, you are forgiven for thinking that this question has no answer and the whole factorial thing is "fake news". However, there is a 'trick' to get around this: **setting the value of the zero-factorial to a number** by definition.

And, hence, we arrive at the convention:

`0! = 1`

A small disclaimer is needed here since in maths things are never as easy as "choose a number a roll with it", there are many complex reasons as to why the value of zero-factorial has been set to `1` and not any other number. Explaining these reasons is far beyond the scope of this factorial calculator.

## Basic values of factorials

Let's check now some of the value for the n-factorial of several small `n`, like zero factorial (0 factorial), 5 factorial, 3 factorial... Pay special attention to the value of 0 factorial because it is the most important one and we will talk more about it later.

* 0! = 1
* 1! = 1
* 2! = 2
* 3! = 6
* 4! = 24
* 5! = 120
* 6! = 720
* 7! = 5040
* 8! = 40 320
* 9! = 362 880
* 10! = 3 628 800

We can see hot fast the factorial of a number increases as we keep using bigger numbers. This is yet another situation where  <portal cid=161>scientific notation</portal> can save the day if you need to work with such big numbers. For factorials of numbers greater than 10, don't hesitate to use the factorial calculator above.

## 0-Factorial and why it is so special

The 0-factorial is a key part of the factorial definition. To understand why it is so important we can show the problems when we try to calculate the zero-factorial using the factorial formula above:

`0! = 0 * (0-1)!` 

It looks like no matter what the value of `(0-1)!` turns out to be, the result should always be `0! = 0` but things are more complicated than that in maths. We saw in the previous section that the n-factorial is only defined for n > 0, so we have a problem here.`(0-1)!` is what mathematicians call: **undefined expression** which means that the expression is not correct and thus it has no mathematical meaning. This is the same problems as with division by zero, it's not that we cannot calculate it, the problem is that the expression doesn't make sense.

This is a reason why `0!` is important to define as a convention value. Setting it's value  to `0! = 0` would not be a good idea since it would mean that `n! = 0` for any value of `n`. You can see why by applying the factorial formula. On the other hand, if we set zero-factorial to `1` we now retain the expected values for n-factorial while having a simple convention for the value of `0!`. 

We will see in the following section another reasoning behind setting zero-factorial to be equal to `1`, with a more mathematical reasoning. In doing that we will also introduce the **Gamma function** which is in plain terms an **extended factorial formula** that includes all positive numnbers and the 0-factorial.

## Gamma function: Factorials of non-integer values

It is possible to determine the factorial of non-integer numbers - basically, for all real numbers excluding negative integers. It requires the use of complex mathematical tools, so we will try to give a simpler version here, retaining as much accuracy as we can. In fact there have been several approaches to extending the factorial formula to include all positive numbers, each of them with subtle differences and all of them mostly compatible with each other.

Let's start with the Gamma function. The Gamma function is a function that extends the notion of the n-factorial beyond integers. Obviously the formula cannot be the same as we have used before because we would end up on a dead-end. In fact this function extends the n-factorial to complex numbers as well, where the intuitive notion of a factorial is much harder to grasp.

	`ùö™(z) = ‚à´t·∂ª‚Åª¬π e‚Åª·µó dt`

That's the definitions of the Gamma function, where `t` is the variable of integration and `z` is a complex number with a positive real part. This formula reduced to the n-factorial when applied over any positive integer `n`. 

	`n! = ùö™(n+1)`
	
You can see 2 things from this formula: (1) The Gamma function is much more complicated to use than the n-factorial formula for integers and (2) it is not a true copy of the n-factorial since you need to calculate the value of the Gamma function for `n+1` to obtain `n!`. To remedy this last "_problem_" we can introduce the Pi function.

	`ùö∑	(z)= ‚à´t·∂ª e‚Åª·µó`

The Pi function is very similar to the Gamma function but shifted just enough so that the factorial and the function would match up.

	`ùö∑	(n) = n! n ‚àà ùó°` 

After all you might be bewildered by the complexity of the maths behind this factorial formula, but **don't fret!**. As a simple trick we can tell you that `(-0.5)! = ‚àöœÄ` and `(0.5)! = 0.5‚àöœÄ`.

Interestingly, the factorial formula is still valid here. So, for example,

`(2.5)! = 2.5 * (1.5)! = 2.5 * 1.5 * (0.5)! = 1.875‚àöœÄ`

## Python factorial and how to calculate factorial in programming languages

In our modern world the tedious calculations are generally left off to the computers (just like you're doing by using this calculator). Increasingly common is the usage of coding languages to create small programs that will make those calculations for us. The n-factorial is a perfect candidate since it's not really complex conceptually but for big numbers it requires too much time for humans to calculate. For those of you that are using programming languages we will leave you some example for some of the most coding languages.

* **Python factorial**(after 2.6): Use `math.factorial(x)` to get in Python factorial values
* **Java factorial**: There is no 'Java factorial' method in the standard Java packages.
* **Factorial matlab**: To calculate a factorial, matlab uses `factorial(x)`
* **Factorial in excel**: Use `math.factorial(x)` to get in Python factorial values
* **Factorial c++**: There is not factorial c++ function included in the standard libraries
* **Factorial javascript**: There is not factorial javascript function included in the standard libraries

We can also define a factorial in a more precise, mathematical manner:

`n! = 1` if `n = 0` and

`n! = n * (n-1)!` otherwise.

Notice that you don't have to do all the calculations to determine a factorial. For example, you already know that `6! = 720`. If you want to calculate `8!`, you can simply use the formula above:

`8! = 8 * 7! = 8 * 7 * 6! = 56 * 720 = 40 320`

Also, dividing factorials is easier than you'd think. For instance,

`8!/5! = 8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 / (5*4*3*2*1) = 8*7*6 = 336`

Of course, you can also use our factorial calculator and spare yourself some time. Just enter the number in the box above. The result is presented using <portal cid="161">scientific notation</portal>. If you decide to keep this notation, remember about using a correct number of <portal cid="392">significant figures</portal>.
