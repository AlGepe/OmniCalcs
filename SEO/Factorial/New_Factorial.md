Our factorial calculator is a tool that can determine the factorial of any natural number from 0 up to 170

## Exclamation point in Maths: What is a factorial?

 <-- WAT IMAGE-->

 When you see for the first time an exclamation point in maths you probably got shocked or even thought you that there was some kind of mistake or typo. But the reality is different: this exclamation point in maths is called the factorial or n-factorial. The factorial is a fairly unknown operator, that in reality can be viewed more as an abbreviation than a true operator in itself, at least at the beginning.

To understand what the factorial does or means we should start with an example. We could chose any number `n` and calculate its n-factorial value but the best is to choose a fairly small number, so let's use 5-factorial.

`5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`

From this example you can get and intuition of what is a factorial and even take a guess at the factorial formula. You can also understand why this exclamation point in maths can be regarded as an abbreviation, since it is not a new operation but rather a collection of multiplications.

 

The easiest definition of n-factorial, denoted *n!*, is a product of all positive natural numbers smaller or equal to *n*. For example,

`6! = 6*5*4*3*2*1 = 720`

The value of 0! is by convention equal to 1. 

Factorial is most often used in combinatorics, for instance when calculating the number of combinations and permutations. 

## Getting mathematical: Factorial definition and Factorial formula

We can also define a factorial in a more precise, mathematical manner:

`n! = 1` if `n = 0` and

`n! = n * (n-1)!` otherwise.

Notice that you don't have to do all the calculations to determine a factorial. For example, you already know that `6! = 720`. If you want to calculate `8!`, you can simply use the formula above:

`8! = 8 * 7! = 8 * 7 * 6! = 56 * 720 = 40 320`

Also, dividing factorials is easier than you'd think. For instance,

`8!/5! = 8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 / (5*4*3*2*1) = 8*7*6 = 336`

Of course, you can also use our factorial calculator and spare yourself some time. Just enter the number in the box above.

## Basic values of factorials

Let's check now some of the value for the n-factorial of several small `n`, like zero factorial (0 factorial), 5 factorial, 3 factorial... Pay special attention to the value of 0 factorial because it is the most important one and we will talk more about it later.

* 0! = 1
* 1! = 1
* 2! = 2
* 3! = 6
* 4! = 24
* 5! = 120
* 6! = 720
* 7! = 5040
* 8! = 40 320
* 9! = 362 880
* 10! = 3 628 800

For factorials of numbers greater than 10, don't hesitate to use the factorial calculator above.

## 0-Factorial and why it is so special

## Gamma function: Factorials of non-integer values

It is possible to determine the factorial of non-integer numbers - basically, for all real numbers excluding negative integers. It requires the use of complex mathematical tools, so we will try to give a simpler version here, retaining as much accuracy as we can.

After all you might be bewildered by the complexity of the maths behind this factorial formula, but **don't fret!**. As a simple trick we can tell you that `(-0.5)! = √π` and `(0.5)! = 0.5√π`.
Interestingly, the factorial formula is still valid here. So, for example,

`(2.5)! = 2.5 * (1.5)! = 2.5 * 1.5 * (0.5)! = 1.875√π`
