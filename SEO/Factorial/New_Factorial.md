Our factorial calculator is a tool that can determine the factorial of any natural number from 0 up to 170

## Exclamation point in Maths: What is a factorial?

The easiest definition of n-factorial, denoted *n!*, is a product of all positive natural numbers smaller or equal to *n*. For example,

`6! = 6*5*4*3*2*1 = 720`

The value of 0! is by convention equal to 1. 

Factorial is most often used in combinatorics, for instance when calculating the number of combinations and permutations. 

## Getting mathematical: Factorial definition and Factorial formula

We can also define a factorial in a more precise, mathematical manner:

`n! = 1` if `n = 0` and

`n! = n * (n-1)!` otherwise.

Notice that you don't have to do all the calculations to determine a factorial. For example, you already know that `6! = 720`. If you want to calculate `8!`, you can simply use the formula above:

`8! = 8 * 7! = 8 * 7 * 6! = 56 * 720 = 40 320`

Also, dividing factorials is easier than you'd think. For instance,

`8!/5! = 8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 / (5*4*3*2*1) = 8*7*6 = 336`

Of course, you can also use our factorial calculator and spare yourself some time. Just enter the number in the box above. The result is presented using <portal cid="161">scientific notation</portal>. If you decide to keep this notation, remember about using a correct number of <portal cid="392">significant figures</portal>.

## Basic values of factorials

Let's check now some of the value for the factorial of several small numbers like zero factorial (0 factorial), 5 factorial, 3 factorial... Pay special attention to the value of 0 factorial because it is the most important one and we will talk more about it later.

* 0! = 1
* 1! = 1
* 2! = 2
* 3! = 6
* 4! = 24
* 5! = 120
* 6! = 720
* 7! = 5040
* 8! = 40 320
* 9! = 362 880
* 10! = 3 628 800

For factorials of numbers greater than 10, don't hesitate to use the factorial calculator above.

## 0-Factorial and why it is so special

## Gamma function: Factorials of non-integer values

It is possible to determine the factorial of non-integer numbers - basically, for all real numbers excluding negative integers. It requires the use of complex mathematical tools, so we will try to give a simpler version here, retaining as much accuracy as we can.

After all you might be bewildered by the complexity of the maths behind this factorial formula, but **don't fret!**. As a simple trick we can tell you that `(-0.5)! = √π` and `(0.5)! = 0.5√π`.
Interestingly, the factorial formula is still valid here. So, for example,

`(2.5)! = 2.5 * (1.5)! = 2.5 * 1.5 * (0.5)! = 1.875√π`
