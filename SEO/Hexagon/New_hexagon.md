The hexagon shape is one of the most popular shapes in nature, from honeycomb patterns to hexagon tiles for mirrors its uses are almost endless. Here we will not only explain why the 6-sided polygon is so popular, but also how to draw a hexagon while we also answer the question "what is an hexagon?" using the hexagon definition. This being a hexagon calculator we will explore as well the geometrical properties and calculations including how to find the area of a regular hexagon as well as explaining how to use the calculator to simplify any calculation involving this 6-sided shape.

## How many sides does a hexagon have? Exploring the 6-sided shape

It should come as no surprise that the hexagon (a.k.a. _"6-sided polygon"_) has precisely 6 sides. This is true for all hexagons since it is their defining feature. The length of the sides can vary from one to another except for the **regular hexagon in which all sides must have equal length**. We will dive a bit deeper into such shape later on, in particular regarding how to find the area of a regular hexagon. For now it suffices to say that the regular hexagon is not only the most common way to represent a 6-sided polygon, but also the one most often found in nature.

There will be a whole section dedicated to the important properties of the hexagon shape but first we need to know the technical answer to: "What is a hexagon?" This will help us understand the tricks we can use to **calculate the area of a hexagon without using the hexagon area formula** blindly. This tricks will involve using other <portal cid=1116>polygons</portal> such as the <portal cid=1085>square</portal>, <portal cid=906>triangles</portal> and even <portal cid=933> parallelograms</portal>.
## Hexagon definition, what is a hexagon?

In very much the same fashion as an <portal cid=569>octagon</portal> is defined as having 8 angles, the hexagonal shape is technically **defined as having 6 angles** which conversely means that (as we saw before) that the hexagonal shape is always a 6-sided shape. The angles of an arbitrary hexagon can have any value but they all together have to sum up to 720º which you can easily convert to other units using our <portal cid=211>angle conversion calculator</portal>.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://uploads-cdn.omnicalculator.com/images/Al_HexLetters.png" alt="According to the Hexagon definition this is an hexagon" style="width:60%" align="center"> </p>

In a regular hexagon, however, all the hexagon sides and angles have to have the same value. For the sides any value is accepted as long as they are all the same. This means that for a regular hexagon, calculating the perimeter is so easy that you don't even need to use the <portal cid=1115>perimeter of a polygon calculator</portal> if you know a bit of maths. Just calculate: 
`Perimeter = 6 * side`
where `side` refers to the length of any one side.

As for the angles, a regular hexagon requires that all angles are equal and the sum up to 720º which means that **each individual angle must be a 120º** one. This will prove to be of the utmost importance when we talk about the popularity of the hexagon shape in nature. It will also be useful when explaining how to find the area of a regular hexagon, since we will be using this angles to figure out which <portal cid=1078>triangle are calculator</portal> to use, or even to know the properties of the <portal cid=749>rectangle</portal> that we will use in another method.

## Hexagon area formula: how to find the area of a regular hexagon

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://uploads-cdn.omnicalculator.com/images/Al_HexArea.png" alt="Tricks on how to find the area of a regular hexagon" style="width:60%" align="center"> </p>

We will see now how to find the area of a regular hexagon using different tricks. The easiest way is to use our calculator, that includes a built-in <portal cid="210">area conversion</portal> tool. For those who want to know how they could do this by hand we will explain how to find the area of a regular hexagon with and without the hexagon are formula. The formula for the <portal cid=1114>area of a polygon</portal> is always the same no matter how many sides it has as long as it is a **regular polygon**:

`Area = Apothem * Perimeter /2`

If you don't remember the formula, you can always think about the 6-sided polygon as a collection of 6 angles. For the regular hexagon these triangles are <portal cid=983>equilateral triangles</portal>. This makes it much easier to calculate their area than it they were <portal cid=981>isosceles triangles</portal> or even <portal cid=1076>45 45 90 triangles</portal> as in the case of the octagon. 

For the regular triangle all sides are the same length, which is the length of the side of the hexagon they form. We will call this `a`. And <portal cid=1082>height of a triangle</portal> will be `h = √3/2 * a` which is exactly the value of the `Apothem`. Using this we can start with the maths:

`A₀ = a * h / 2 = a * √3/2 * a / 2 = √3/4 * a²`

After multiplying this area by six (because we have 6 triangles), we get the hexagon area formula:

`A = 6 * A₀ = 6 * √3/4 * a²`

`A = 3 * √3/2 * a² = (√3/2 * a) * (6 * a) /2 = Apothem * Perimeter /2`

And you can see that in this manner we arrive at the same hexagon are formula we mentioned before.

If you want to get exotic you can play with other different shapes. For example, if you divide the hexagon in half (from vertex to vertex) you get 2 trapezoids, and you can calculate the area of the hexagon as the sum of both, using our <portal cid=595>trapezoid area calculator</portal>.

Feel free to play around with different shape and calculators and see what other tricks you can come up with. Can you use only <portal cid=257> right triangles</portal> or maybe even <portal cid=1078>special right triangles</portal> to calculate the area of a hexagon? Check out the <portal cid=1100>area of the right triangle calculator</portal> for help with the computations.

## Diagonals of a hexagon

The total number of hexagon's diagonals is equal to 9 - three of these are long diagonals that cross the central point, and the other six are also called the "height" of the hexagon.
Our hexagon calculator can also spare you some tedious calculations on the lengths of the hexagon's diagonals. There are two types of these diagonals:

* Long diagonals - they always cross the central point of the hexagon. As you can notice from the picture above, the length of such a diagonal is equal to two edge lengths: `D = 2a`.
* Short diagonals - also called the height of the triangle, these diagonals do not cross the central point. Their length is equal to `d = √3 * a`.

## Circumradius and inradius 

Another pair of values that are important in a hexagon are the circumradius and the inradius. The circumradius is the radius of the <portal cid=288>circumference<portal> that contains all the vertices of the regular hexagon. The inradius is the radius of the biggest <portal cid=752>circle</portal> contained entirely inside the hexagon.

* Circumradius: to find the radius of a circle circumscribed on the regular hexagon, you need to determine the distance between the central point of the hexagon (that is also the center of the circle) and any of the vertices. It is simply equal to `R = a`.
* Inradius: the radius of a circle inscribed in the regular hexagon is equal to a half of its height, which is also the apothem : `r = √3/2 * a`.

## How to draw a hexagon shape

Now we are going to explore a more practical and less mathematical world: how to draw a hexagon. For a randome (irregular) hexagon the answer is simple: draw any 6-sided shape so that it is a closed polygon and you're done. But for a **regular hexagon things are not so easy** since we have to make sure all the sides are the same length.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://uploads-cdn.omnicalculator.com/images/Al_HexDraw.gif" alt="How to draw a hexagon shape, the easy way" style="width:60%" align="center"> </p>

Ideally we would have a **drawing compass** and we would get a perfect result. Just draw a circumference and with the same radius start making marks along it starting at a random point and **making the next mark using the previous one as the anchor** point for the compass. You will end up with 6 marks and if you **join them with a straight line**, you will have yourself a regular hexagon. You can see a similar process on **the animation above**.

## The easiest way to find a hexagon side, area... The hexagon calculator

The hexagon calculator allows you to calculate several interesting parameter of 6-sided shape that we normally call hexagon. The usage is as simple as it can possibly get with only one of the parameters needed to calculate the rest and a built-in <portal cid=208>length conversion</portal> tool for each of them. 

We have discussed all the parameters of the calculator but for the sake of clarity and completeness we will now go over them briefly:

* `Area`: 2-D surface enclosed by the polygon
* `Side Length`: Distance from one vertex to the other
* `Perimeter`: Sum of the length of all sides
* `Long Diagonal`: Distance from one vertex to the opposed one
* `Short Diagonal`: Same as the height of the 6-sided polygon
* `Circumcircle radius`: Same as the radius of the polygon 
* `Incircle radius`: Same as the apothem

If you like the simplicity of this calculator we invite you to try other polygon calculators such as the <portal cid=1113>regular pentagon calculator</portal> or even 3-D calculators such as the  <portal cid=900>pyramid calculator</portal>, <portal cid=956> triangular prism calculator</portal>, or the  <portal cid=955>rectangular prism calculator</portal>.

## Hexagon tiles and real-world uses of the 6-sided polygon

Everyone loves a **good real-world application**, and hexagons are definitely one of the most used polygons in the world. Starting with human usages the easiest (and probably least interesting) is hexagon <portal cid=190>tiles</portal> for flooring purposes. The hexagon is a really good shape because it perfectly fits with one another to cover any desired area. If you're interested in such a use we recommend the <portal cid=1195>flooring calculator</portal> and the <portal cid=173>square footage calculator</portal> as very good tool for this purpose.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://uploads-cdn.omnicalculator.com/images/Al_HexDiffraction.jpg" alt="Diffraction grating pattern for different apperture shapes, including the hexagon" style="width:80%" align="center"> </p>

The next use case is common to all polygons but it is still interesting to see. In photography, the opening of the sensor almost always have a polygonal shape. This part of the camera called <portal cid=1027>aperture</portal> dictates many properties and features of the pictures taken by the camera. The most unexpected one is the shape of very bright (point-lik) objects due to the effect called <portal cid=682>diffraction grating</portal> and it is illustrated in the picture above.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://uploads-cdn.omnicalculator.com/images/Al_HexTelescope.png" alt="The six sided polygon is widely use in photography and astronomy" style="width:60%" align="center"> </p>

One of the most important uses of hexagons in the modern era, closely related to the one we've talked about in photography, is the one in astronomy. In astronomy one of the biggest problems when trying to observe distant stars is how faint they are in the night sky. That is because despite being very bright objects the are so far away that only a very small amount of their light reaches us; you can learn more about that in our <portal cid=723> luminosity calculator</portal>. On top of that due to relativistic effects (similar to <portal cid=431>time dilation</portal> and <portal cid=751>length contraction</portal>), their light arrives on the Earth with less energy that it was emitted. This effect is called <portal cid=990>red-shift</portal>.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://uploads-cdn.omnicalculator.com/images/Al_HexTelescope2.jpg" alt="Segmented mirror for a telescope" style="width:60%" align="center"> </p>

All in all the result is that we get very small amount of energy and with a bigger <portal cid=421>wavelength</portal> than we would like. The best way to counteract this is to build telescopes as big as possible. The problem is that making a one-piece lens or mirror bigger than a couple meter is almost impossible, not to talk about the problems with the logistics. The solutions is to build a modular mirror using hexagon tiles like the ones you can see in the pictures.

Making such big mirrors improves the <portal cid=969>angular resolution</portal> of the telescope as well as the <portal cid=901>magnification factor</portal> due to the geometrical properties of a _"Cassegrain telescope"_. So we can say that thanks to regular hexagons we can see better, further and more clear than we could have ever done with only one-piece lenses or mirrors.

## Honeycomb pattern and why the 6-sided shape is so popular in nature

The Honeycomb pattern composed of regular hexagon arrange side by side filling the entire surface the spam without any whole in between them. This honeycomb pattern appears not only in honeycombs (surprise!) but in many other places in nature. In fact, it is so popular that one could say it is the default shape when conflicting forces are at play and spheres are not possible due to the nature of the problem.
