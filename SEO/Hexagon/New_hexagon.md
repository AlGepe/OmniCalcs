The hexagon shape is one of the most popular shapes in nature, from honeycomb patterns to hexagon tiles for mirrors its uses are almost endless. Here we will not only explain why the 6-sided polygon is so popular, but also how to draw a hexagon while we also answer the question "what is an hexagon?" using the hexagon definition. This being a hexagon calculator we will explore as well the geometrical properties and calculations including how to find the area of a regular hexagon as well as explaining how to use the calculator to simplify any calculation involving this 6-sided shape.

## How many sides does a hexagon have? Exploring the 6-sided shape

It should come as no surprise that the hexagon (a.k.a. _"6-sided polygon"_) has precisely 6 sides. This is true for all hexagons since it is their defining feature. The length of the sides can vary from one to another except for the **regular hexagon in which all sides must have equal length**. We will dive a bit deeper into such shape later on, in particular regarding how to find the area of a regular hexagon. For now it suffices to say that the regular hexagon is not only the most common way to represent a 6-sided polygon, but also the one most often found in nature.

There will be a whole section dedicated to the important properties of the hexagon shape but first we need to know the technical answer to: "What is a hexagon?" This will help us understand the tricks we can use to **calculate the area of a hexagon without using the hexagon area formula** blindly. This tricks will involve using other <portal cid=1116>polygons</portal> such as the <portal cid=1085>square</portal>, <portal cid=906>triangles</portal> and even <portal cid=933> parallelograms</portal>.
## Hexagon definition, what is a hexagon?

In very much the same fashion as an <portal cid=569>octagon</portal> is defined as having 8 angles, the hexagonal shape is technically **defined as having 6 angles** which conversely means that (as we saw before) that the hexagonal shape is always a 6-sided shape. The angles of an arbitrary hexagon can have any value but they all together have to sum up to 720º which you can easily convert to other units using our <portal cid=211>angle conversion calculator</portal>.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://uploads-cdn.omnicalculator.com/images/Al_HexLetters.png" alt="According to the Hexagon definition this is an hexagon" style="width:60%" align="center"> </p>

In a regular hexagon, however, all the hexagon sides and angles have to have the same value. For the sides any value is accepted as long as they are all the same. This means that for a regular hexagon, calculating the perimeter is so easy that you don't even need to use the <portal cid=1115>perimeter of a polygon calculator</portal> if you know a bit of maths. Just calculate: 
`Perimeter = 6 * side`
where `side` refers to the length of any one side.

As for the angles, a regular hexagon requires that all angles are equal and the sum up to 720º which means that **each individual angle must be a 120º** one. This will prove to be of the utmost importance when we talk about the popularity of the hexagon shape in nature. It will also be useful when explaining how to find the area of a regular hexagon, since we will be using this angles to figure out which <portal cid=1078>triangle are calculator</portal> to use, or even to know the properties of the <portal cid=749>rectangle</portal> that we will use in another method.

## Hexagon area formula: how to find the area of a regular hexagon

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://uploads-cdn.omnicalculator.com/images/Al_HexArea.png" alt="Tricks on how to find the area of a regular hexagon" style="width:60%" align="center"> </p>

We will see now how to find the area of a regular hexagon using different tricks. The easiest way is to use our calculator, that includes a built-in <portal cid="210">area conversion</portal> tool. For those who want to know how they could do this by hand we will explain how to find the area of a regular hexagon with and without the hexagon are formula. The formula for the <portal cid=1114>area of a polygon</portal> is always the same no matter how many sides it has as long as it is a **regular polygon**:

`Area = Apothem * Perimeter /2`

If you don't remember the formula, you can always think about the 6-sided polygon as a collection of 6 angles. For the regular hexagon these triangles are <portal cid=983>equilateral triangles</portal>. This makes it much easier to calculate their area than it they were <portal cid=981>isosceles triangles</portal> or even <portal cid=1076>45 45 90 triangles</portal> as in the case of the octagon. 

For the regular triangle all sides are the same length, which is the length of the side of the hexagon they form. We will call this `a`. And <portal cid=1082>height of a triangle</portal> will be `h = √3/2 * a` which is exactly the value of the `Apothem`. Using this we can start with the maths:

`A₀ = a * h / 2 = a * √3/2 * a / 2 = √3/4 * a²`

After multiplying this area by six (because we have 6 triangles), we get the hexagon area formula:

`A = 6 * A₀ = 6 * √3/4 * a²`

`A = 3 * √3/2 * a² = (√3/2 * a) * (6 * a) /2 = Apothem * Perimeter /2`

And you can see that in this manner we arrive at the same hexagon are formula we mentioned before.

If you want to get exotic you can play with other different shapes. For example, if you divide the hexagon in half (from vertex to vertex) you get 2 trapezoids, and you can calculate the area of the hexagon as the sum of both, using our <portal cid=595>trapezoid area calculator</portal>.

Feel free to play around with different shape and calculators and see what other tricks you can come up with. Can you use only <portal cid=257> right triangles</portal> or maybe even <portal cid=1078>special right triangles</portal> to calculate the area of a hexagon? Check out the <portal cid=1100>area of the right triangle calculator</portal> for help with the computations.

## Diagonals of a hexagon

The total number of hexagon's diagonals is equal to 9 - three of these are long diagonals that cross the central point, and the other six are also called the "height" of the hexagon.
Our hexagon calculator can also spare you some tedious calculations on the lengths of the hexagon's diagonals. There are two types of these diagonals:

* Long diagonals - they always cross the central point of the hexagon. As you can notice from the picture above, the length of such a diagonal is equal to two edge lengths: `D = 2a`.
* Short diagonals - also called the height of the triangle, these diagonals do not cross the central point. Their length is equal to `d = √3 * a`.

## Circumradius and inradius 

Another pair of values that are important in a hexagon are the circumradius and the inradius. The circumradius is the radius of the <portal cid=288>circumference<portal> that contains all the vertices of the regular hexagon. The inradius is the radius of the biggest <portal cid=752>circle</portal> contained entirely inside the hexagon.

* Circumradius: to find the radius of a circle circumscribed on the regular hexagon, you need to determine the distance between the central point of the hexagon (that is also the center of the circle) and any of the vertices. It is simply equal to `R = a`.
* Inradius: the radius of a circle inscribed in the regular hexagon is equal to a half of its height, which is also the apothem : `r = √3/2 * a`.

If you're stuck solving geometry problems involving polygons, this hexagon calculator will surely be of use to you. Apart from a handy hexagon area formula and perimeter formula, it will also help you in calculating the lengths of its diagonals and the radii or an inscribed and circumscribed <portal cid="288">circle</portal>. Stop wondering what are the internal angles equal to, or how to find the area of a hexagon, and solve those pesky math problems in no time!

## Properties of a regular hexagon

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Regular_polygon_6_annotated.svg/503px-Regular_polygon_6_annotated.svg.png" alt="regular hexagon" class="TopicIllustration" style="width:100%"/>

 A regular hexagon, just like an <portal cid="569">octagon</portal>, is a geometric figure called a polygon. It has six edges of equal <portal cid="208">length</portal>. The internal angle at each of the six vertices measures exactly 120°. The total number of hexagon's diagonals is equal to 9 - three of these are long diagonals that cross the central point, and the other six are also called the "height" of the hexagon.
 
The easiest way to construct a regular hexagon is by drawing six equilateral triangles that all have a common vertex in the central point of the hexagon.

## How to find the area of a hexagon?

Calculating the <portal cid="210">area</portal> of the hexagon is very simple. The general idea is to calculate the areas of the six triangles that the hexagon is comprised of and adding them together.

The length of a hexagon's edge - and consequently, also the length of a triangle's edge - is called **a**. Then, we can express the area of one triangle as:

`A₀ = a * h / 2 = a * √3/2 * a / 2 = √3/4 * a²`

After multiplying this area by six, we get the hexagon area formula:

`A = 6 * A₀ = 6 * √3/4 * a²`

`A = 3 * √3/2 * a²`

Of course, you don't have to perform these calculations manually - just plug the edge length into the hexagon calculator and watch it determine the area for you!

## Diagonals of a hexagon

Our hexagon calculator can also spare you some tedious calculations while determining the lengths of the hexagon's diagonals. There are two types of these diagonals:

* Long diagonals - they always cross the central point of the hexagon. As you can notice from the picture above, the length of such a diagonal is equal to two edge lengths: `D = 2a`.
* Short diagonals - also called the height of the triangle, these diagonals do not cross the central point. Their length is equal to `d = √3 * a`.

## Circumradius and inradius 

The last two values that our hexagon calculator can easily find are the radii of a circumscribed and an inscribed circle. 

* Circumradius: to find the radius of a circle circumscribed on the regular hexagon, you need to determine the distance between the central point of the hexagon (that is also the center of the circle) and any of the vertices. It is simply equal to `R = a`.
* Inradius: the radius of a circle inscribed in the regular hexagon is equal to a half of its height: `r = √3/2 * a`.
