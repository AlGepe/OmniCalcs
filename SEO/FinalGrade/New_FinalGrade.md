## What is the final grade

Before we get into the _nitty gritty_ of how to use this final grade calculator or justifying its use, it is worth making sure we are all in the same page and know what is the final grade. The final grade of a subject or of a semester is the compilation of your relevant grades combined and averaged according to its individual weight. This might seem complicated but it's easier that it looks.

For many subjects, the final grade is the grade you would get in the final (and only) exam. If this is your case, close the browser and get to studying you're not trying to calculate anything, you're procrastinating ðŸ˜› In many other cases, one subject might have multiple examination tests that can range form smaller mid-term exams, to written essays, oral presentations... In those cases you need to know the weight of each of the items of examination.

The weight of each of these examination items is no more than a mathematical representation of their importance. Generally the weights are expressed as a percentage of the total grade or as a number from 0 to 1, which represents the same concept. 

There is also the final semester grade, which you can obtain using this calculator. The final semester grade is the combination of all the grades of all the subjects you took in a given semester. Generally these grades tend to have the same weight, but sometimes different subjects have different credit counts or value to your final degree. In the later case, the weighting system works the same as in the case of an individual subject with multiple examination processes.

There are multiple grading system with different values and nomenclatures, so we have to settle for one as the default in any future example we will make. For simplicity we will assume a grading system from 0 to 10 were 5 or higher means passing and lower than 5 means failing.  

## The importance of the final semester grade

When it comes to the grades in your degree, we all know they don't necessarily represent your level of knowledge. However we don't have a better way to assess someone's abilities without performing another exam or a hands-on test period. It is for this reason that final grades matter.

When you apply for a job, that's one of the first things people will look at, and generally speaking, you final grades tell everyone how good they should expect you to be. So yeah, no pressure, but those couple of hours you think you don't need because you are "gonna pass anyway, so whatever" might have an impact in your professional career. 

Increasingly, though, more and more companies are switching their focus from knowledge markers (such as your semester grades) to personality or aptitude markers (such as wide range of interests or personal projects), which is a good thing. This move releases some pressure from the exams themselves, leaving students more free to focus on learning the material rather than learning to pass the exam with high grades.

One area where grades are still crucial, and will probably remain like that for long, is grants and subsidise programs. When you apply for a grant, there are many factors taken into account but almost always your average grade is one of them. 

As unfair as it might be, your final grade matters, and for some people might even be the difference between an average life and fulfilling their dreams, so try to do your best, without losing your mind.

## Not all final grades are equal: grading systems.

Now is time to talk about the <strike>clusterf***</strike> mess that are different grading systems. On the one hand you have simple grading systems like the Spanish one, 0-10 with 5 being a passing grade, or the Polish and Norwegian systems 1-5 with 3 being a passing grade. Numerical systems that allow for easy conversion between them. 

Then things start to get complicated when we look at the USA and their grading system using letters from A to F (generally skipping the letter E). You can be forgiven for thinking this makes conversions really hard and it is very difficult to translate your grade from one country to another.

However, the letter in the North American grading system are have the same meaning as the numbers in other systems, in fact the Norwegian and Polish system have an <a href=https://www.scholaro.com/pro/Countries/poland/Grading-System>almost 1-to-1 equivalence with the system in the United states of America</a>. So at the end of the day converting from one grading system to another is much easier than it would seem.

## What grade do I need on my final exam? Tricks for better time/effort management

One question you might be asking yourself is: What grade do I need on my final exam? And though it might be a lazy question to ask, it's also a very good one if you need to be efficient with your time management. Let's take a look a very common situation that happens to students during the finals period.

Let's assume you're an average student, and let's say you've done well but not excellent on average on you subjects. Now the finals are coming and your goals are twofold: first and foremost you want to pass all the subjects; and given you achieve the first one you want as high a grade as you can possibly get in each of them.

But time is finite and so is you attention. So one way you could go about it would be to answer that question you already have: "_What grade do I need on my final?_" for every subject. By knowing this you can dedicate more time to those subjects that you either find harder, or for which you need a higher grade on your final exam.

Assuming you will pass all your subjects you can later focus on the subjects that would be more relevant for your future career or that you like the best. This might sound like indulging, which it kinda is, but it is also the most efficient since liking something increases your motivation and your will to put effort into it.

And now that you know how important it can be to know what grade you need in your next exam, let's use our final grade calculator and show you how to calculate you final grade. Our calculator is not limited to final exams, it can both work as a semester grade calculator or as a finals calculator, as we will see now.

## How to use the final grade calculator

So it's time to learn how to calculate grades using our semester grade calculator or final grade calculator or final exam grade calculator or however you wanna call it, we don't really care as long as it's helpful for you.

## Beyond the final grade, a word on knowledge and studying


############################################################################################
Final grade calculator is a time-saving device effective for quickly determining what your final grade will be based on some given data. Because getting the right grade could be the difference between getting top honors or simply passing a class, it's necessary to know exactly what grade you need to get on that last exam in order to receive the grade you need or desire. If you are interested in the final grade calculator, you might be interested checking out the <portal cid="265">average calculator</portal> too.

## What are the basics involved in the final grade calculator?

Let's breakdown the values needed and look at a simple formula. 
* **Current grade**: what is your average grade for all the work done in class so far. For example, 80%. It might be helpful to use our <portal cid="259">grade calculator</portal> if you're having any difficulties figuring out your current grade.
* **Final exam's weight**: how much your final exam is worth compared to all the other class values (assignments, projects, quizzes, etc.) For instance, 40% of your overall grade.
* **Required grade**: this is the final grade you get in the class, and the one you need to pass the class or achiever your personal goals. For example, let's say it's 85%.
* **Final exam grade needed**: the final exam grade you need to score in order to get the 'required grade'. Given all the values mentioned above, the Final Exam grade needed is 92.5%.

Let's put all these values together in one simple equation now: 

## How to calculate the final grade?

To use the final grade calculator you must supply some basic data. First, you need to know what your current grade is. Then, you need to plug in the weight of the final exam. Teachers and professors normally supply that information in the class syllabus or provide it at some moment during the course. Once you determine what those values are, you need to supply only one more value, namely, the required grade. This is the minimum grade you need or want in order to achieve your academic aims, whatever they may be. Let's consider the following example:

1. Imagine your current grade is an 88%
1. The final exam weight counts for 50% of your overall grade (it's a <portal cid="264">weighted average</portal>, where the final exam usually is more important than anything else that came before).
1. You want to get a 93% in the class (an A or top percentage bracket depending on the grading method)
1. You will need to score at least a 97% on the final exam.

## How is the final grade calculator useful?

Academic life implies schoolwork and ultimately some form of evaluation of performance. Being able to correctly estimate what kind of effort you need to put into a course can be a big deal when you have many different classes to attend. Time is a limited quantity and so is personal energy. Doing some clever calculations, students can intelligently organize their time in order to get the best grades where it matters most. 

The final grade calculator is just one means to this end. Instead of studying blindly, students can use it to decide how and where to invest the best of their study time and energy.  You might cut down study time on the course where you need a lower final exam grade and invest that valuable time working harder in another area. Whether you just need a passing grade or a single percentage point higher to get that *summa cum laude*, the final grade calculator can save you a bit of study time by quickly informing you exactly what kind of final exam grade you need to achieve your goal.
