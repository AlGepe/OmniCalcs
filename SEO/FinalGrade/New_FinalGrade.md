We present to you the final grade calculator: a simple-to-use tool that will allow you to effortlessly calculate your final exam grade so you can focus on studying hard. In this calculator we will answer your question: "_What grade do I need on my final_" and why it matters. On top of all that, in this final exam grade calculator we will teach you how to calculate your semester grade by hand or using our convenient <portal cid=265>average calculator</portal>

## What is the final grade

Before we get into the _nitty gritty_ of how to use this final grade calculator or justifying its use, it is worth making sure we are all in the same page and know what is the final grade. The final grade of a subject or of a semester is the compilation of your relevant grades combined and averaged according to its individual weight. This might seem complicated but it's easier that it looks.

For many subjects, the final grade is the grade you would get in the final (and only) exam. If this is your case, close the browser and get to studying you're not trying to calculate anything, you're procrastinating ðŸ˜› In many other cases, one subject might have multiple examination tests that can range form smaller mid-term exams, to written essays, oral presentations... In those cases you need to know the weight of each of the items of examination.

The weight of each of these examination items is no more than a mathematical representation of their importance. Generally the weights are expressed as a percentage of the total grade or as a number from 0 to 1, which represents the same concept. 

There is also the final semester grade, which you can obtain using this calculator. The final semester grade is the combination of all the grades of all the subjects you took in a given semester. Generally these grades tend to have the same weight, but sometimes different subjects have different credit counts or value to your final degree. In the later case, the weighting system works the same as in the case of an individual subject with multiple examination processes.

There are multiple grading system with different values and nomenclatures, so we have to settle for one as the default in any future example we will make. For simplicity we will assume a grading system from 0 to 10 were 5 or higher means passing and lower than 5 means failing.  

## The importance of the final semester grade

When it comes to the grades in your degree, we all know they don't necessarily represent your level of knowledge. However we don't have a better way to assess someone's abilities without performing another exam or a hands-on test period. It is for this reason that final grades matter.

When you apply for a job, that's one of the first things people will look at, and generally speaking, you final grades tell everyone how good they should expect you to be. So yeah, no pressure, but those couple of hours you think you don't need because you are "gonna pass anyway, so whatever" might have an impact in your professional career. 

Increasingly, though, more and more companies are switching their focus from knowledge markers (such as your semester grades) to personality or aptitude markers (such as wide range of interests or personal projects), which is a good thing. This move releases some pressure from the exams themselves, leaving students more free to focus on learning the material rather than learning to pass the exam with high grades.

One area where grades are still crucial, and will probably remain like that for long, is grants and subsidise programs. When you apply for a grant, there are many factors taken into account but almost always your average grade is one of them. 

As unfair as it might be, your final grade matters, and for some people might even be the difference between an average life and fulfilling their dreams, so try to do your best, without losing your mind.

## Not all final grades are equal: grading systems.

Now is time to talk about the <strike>clusterf***</strike> mess that are different grading systems. On the one hand you have simple grading systems like the Spanish one, 0-10 with 5 being a passing grade, or the Polish and Norwegian systems 1-5 with 3 being a passing grade. Numerical systems that allow for easy conversion between them. 

Then things start to get complicated when we look at the USA and their grading system using letters from A to F (generally skipping the letter E). You can be forgiven for thinking this makes conversions really hard and it is very difficult to translate your grade from one country to another.

However, the letter in the North American grading system are have the same meaning as the numbers in other systems, in fact the Norwegian and Polish system have an <a href=https://www.scholaro.com/pro/Countries/poland/Grading-System>almost 1-to-1 equivalence with the system in the United states of America</a>. So at the end of the day converting from one grading system to another is much easier than it would seem.

## What grade do I need on my final exam? Tricks for better time/effort management

One question you might be asking yourself is: What grade do I need on my final exam? And though it might be a lazy question to ask, it's also a very good one if you need to be efficient with your time management. Let's take a look a very common situation that happens to students during the finals period.

Let's assume you're an average student, and let's say you've done well but not excellent on average on you subjects. Now the finals are coming and your goals are twofold: first and foremost you want to pass all the subjects; and given you achieve the first one you want as high a grade as you can possibly get in each of them.

But time is finite and so is you attention. So one way you could go about it would be to answer that question you already have: "_What grade do I need on my final?_" for every subject. By knowing this you can dedicate more time to those subjects that you either find harder, or for which you need a higher grade on your final exam.

Assuming you will pass all your subjects you can later focus on the subjects that would be more relevant for your future career or that you like the best. This might sound like indulging, which it kinda is, but it is also the most efficient since liking something increases your motivation and your will to put effort into it.

And now that you know how important it can be to know what grade you need in your next exam, let's use our final grade calculator and show you how to calculate you final grade. Our calculator is not limited to final exams, it can both work as a semester grade calculator or as a finals calculator, as we will see now.

## How to use the final grade calculator

So it's time to learn how to calculate grades using our semester grade calculator or final grade calculator or final exam grade calculator or however you wanna call it, we don't really care as long as it's helpful for you. First thing you should do, though, is to familiarise yourself with the calculator.

It might look a bit intimidating at first, but let's go field by field and you'll see that it is actually much easier than it might seem now. Here is a list and a short description of what each field means:

* **Current grade**: The grade you currently have on your subject, before the final exam.
* **Final exam's weight**: Percentage of the final grade of the subject assigned to the final exam. 
* **Required grade**: Passing grade. The minimum grade necessary to achieve your goal.
* **Final exam grade needed**: The grade required to achieve your goal or the passing grade in said subject.

All the fields are expressed in percentage since mathematically is the easiest way to account for all grading systems at once. Also many (final) exams' grades are expressed as a percentage or as fraction of the total amount of points available (perfect score). The only percentage that is a bit different than the rest, conceptually, is the weight of the final exam.

This weight represent the part of the final grade assigned to the final exam alone. For example if we have a grading system with a maximum of 10 points and we have a final exam with a weight of 75% it means that there are `0.75*10 = 7.5 points` in the final grade that correspond directly to the final exam.

Let's take a look at a simple example. Let's say you've enrolled in this subject that is coming to an end. There is only the final exam left for the subject to be over, and throughout the semester you've been doing small projects and mid-term exams for this subject, so that now your current average grade for this subject sits at 65% of the total points you could've gotten. Let's also assume that the final exam grade counts as 70% of the total grade of the subject. 

This means that you have already collected `(1-0.7) * 0.65 * 100 = 19.5%` of the total grade. Let's talk about a grading system over 100 points; if you did not get any point on the final exam you would get a final grade of 19.5points. Now to calculate what grade you need on your final, we need to find how many points you would need to pass. Let's say a passing grade is 50 points.

So that means you need `50-19.5 = 30.5 points` to pass. Since the final exam carries 70% of the final grade, it means that those 30.5 point in the final grade translate to `30.5 / .7 = 43.6 points`. So by getting 43.6% of the final exam correctly you are guaranteed to pass the subject. But please, aim higher than that; just in case ;)

## Beyond the final grade, a word on knowledge and studying

We have touched lightly on the fact that grades don't mean knowledge, so let's expand a bit more on that, almost counter-intuitive, statement. In an ideal world, the exams and tests you have to do to pass a subject would be perfectly designed so that you could only pass if you knew enough. On top of that, since we're talking about the 'perfect' scenario, your grade would exactly represent your level of knowledge in the subject.

However, an exam like this would require a lot of research and planning, would probably need be tailor-made for each student, and would have to be completely different from one year to the next so as to avoid students from just studying previous exams. As you can clearly see, this is far from practical and borderline impossible to achieve in a world where time is limited (as is the capacity of professors).

Enter Real Worldâ„¢ compromises. Professors (and teachers) have limited time and need to optimise it so, for example, having the same type of exam with different questions from year to year is a good and very common compromise.

Another compromise that professors are very likely to do is to only select a few relevant topics from the subject, instead of having questions about everything they taught in the course. This allows exams to be short enough to be done in just a couple of hours as opposed to the several days that it could take to go over the whole subject.

All this compromises allow for exams to actually be performed, but they hinder their accuracy to represent the knowledge of the student. If done correctly, there should still be a high correlation between the knowledge you have and the grade you get, but some times there can be huge disparities.

In the worst cases you might have to decided if you'd rather have great knowledge and average grade or amazing grade and sub-par knowledge. In general we would recommend aiming for knowledge but you are probably the best judge of your situation, if you unfortunately happen to encounter it.

## I finished my exam, I got my final grade, now what?

If you are using this calculator you probably haven't done your exams yet... But at some point you'll be done with them and you will have to stop asking "_what grade do I need on my final?_" and start asking "_and now what?_". If you have finished one of the many years in your studies, enjoy a well deserved break and clear your head from the stressful exam period. However,  if you have just finished high school, college or maybe completed all your university studies, you are far from done. 

The next steps to take are very important in deciding your future, and the most likely thing you would have to (or at least want to) is apply either for your next stage in your education or for a job. For either of them it's important to know how to show your capabilities, interests and knowledge to those who haven't met you yet. A good CV, a well crafted motivational letter and not giving up are some things that will help you succeed getting that position you aim for. 

Here at Omni we cannot write your motivational letter or polish your CV, but still we would like to offer as much help as we can. As we have discussed, your grades are the typical way to prove your knowledge, but not all places use the same grading system. Fear not, because here is where our Omnicalculators can prove very helpful for you.

For starters you can calculate your <portal cid=1322>High School GPA</portal> or your <portal cid=1318>College GPA calculators</portal>. This can be very important if you're applying for a position abroad, since GPA is the _de facto_ international standard for grades. What's more, some colleges have their own way to re-evaluate your grades; generally using a weighted average. Here we can offer you the help of our <portal cid=264>weighted average calculator</portal> to make this process as easy as it can be. 


## Final exam and anxiety, how to balance now and then sensibly

One of the biggest problems associated with final exams is anxiety / stress. As we have mentioned before, getting good grades can be crucial at some points in life. Add to this that exams grow in importances as we get older and we barely face any final exam in our maturity, and that's a recipe for real anxiety problems. 

One very important thing to realise (and it's almost impossible to do before certain age) is that nothing is really "written in stone". We all remember the first real important exams we had and how they felt almost like "life or death" situation... Then as years passed we realised that exams are not always as important as we thought, and that second chances are more common than it seemed when in our younger years. 

That is not to say that exams don't matter and that there's always another chance; not at all. However, there is a level of stress and anxiety that is very unhealthy and counter-productive, and we should try to avoid that at all cost. And for that, it's important to keep in mind that there not a single "life deciding" exam.

Life tends to be the result of multiple important and unimportant decisions, and none of them is 100% responsible for our future. As cheesy as those are, there are many many examples of very successful, highly realised people that did not pass any of the exams that we would consider "hard requirements" to achieve their success; think Steve Jobs dropping out of college if you're out of examples.

Then again, those are just the exceptions to the rule. So the takeaway, if there's any to be gotten from a calculator, is that you're better off getting those grades as high as possible... But there is always another way to your destination.
