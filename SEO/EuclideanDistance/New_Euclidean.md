With the use of the distance calculator, we are able find the distance between two points (x₁,y₁) and (x₂,y₂) on a Cartesian coordinate system. It uses the common distance formula and will compute this distance when you simply enter the coordinates. As you will see in the next section, the distance equation will show how to find the distance between two points and is closely related to the <portal cid="53">Pythagorean theorem</portal>.


## What is distance?

Before we get to how to calculate distances, we should probably clarify what distance is. In the most typical meaning of distance it is the 1D space between two objects. This definition is one way to say what almost all of us think of distance intuitively, but it is not the only way we could talk about distance. You will see in following sections how the concept of distance can be extended beyond <portal cid=208>length</portal>. In fact, in more than one sense, that is the breakthrough behind Einstein's theory of <portal cid=751>relativity</portal>.

If we stick with the geometrical definition of distance we still have to precise what kind of space we are working on. In most cases you are probably talking about 3 dimensions or less, since that's all we can imagine without our brains exploding. For this calculator we will focus only on the 2D distance (with the 1D included as a special case). If you are looking for the 3D distance between 2 points we invite you to use our other calculator made specifically for that purpose. 

To determine the distance between two point, the first thing you need are two points, obviously. These points are described in mathematics by their coordinates in space. For each point in 2D space we need 2 coordinates. These two coordinates are unique to this point. If you wish to find the distance between two point in 1D space you can still use this calculator by simply setting one of the coordinates to be the same for both points. Since this is a very special case, from now on we will talk about distance meaning "_2D distance_".

Next step to do, if you want to be mathematical accurate and precise, is define the type of space you're working on. No, wait, don't run away! It is easier than you think. If you don't know what space you're working on or if you didn't even know there was more than one type of space, you're most likely working in Euclidean space. Since this is the "default" space in which we do almost every geometrical operations, it is the one we have set for the calculator to operate on. Let's dive a bit deeper into Euclidean spaces, what they are, what properties they have and why are so important.

## How to find the distance from one point to another using our distance calculator

As we have mentioned before, distance can mean many things but we focused this calculator on obtaining the distance between two points in 2-D space.  In 2-D space points are defined by two coordinates each, and that's why the distance calculator here has four text boxes for you to fill-in. Using the calculator is very straight-forward, but before you use it, we would recommend you to get acquainted with the distance formula and the procedure you would have to follow if it was 1950 and the Internet was still not a thing.

Suppose we have coordinates `(3,5) and (9,15)` and we want to calculate the distance. The distance formula is `√(x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²`, which relates to the <portal cid=53>Pythagorean theorem</portal>, which is `a² + b² = c²`, where `a` and `b` are legs of a right triangle and `c` is the hypotenuse. Suppose (x₁,y₁) and (x₂,y₂)are coordinates of the endpoints of the hypotenuse. Then `(x₂ - x₁)²` in the distance equation corresponds to `a²` and `(y₂ - y₁)²`corresponds to `b²`. Since `c = √a² + b²`, you can see how it is just an extension of the Pythagorean theorem.

So in a more concrete fashion, this would be the steps your should take to calculate the 2-D distance between these two points:

1. Input the values into the formula: `√(x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²`.
1. Subtract values in parentheses.
1. Square both quantities in parentheses.
1. Add the results.
1. Take the <portal cid="151">square root</portal>.
1. Use the distance equation to check results.

Working the example by hand, we get `√(9-3)²+(15-5)²` = `√36 + 100` = `√136`, which is approximately equal to 11.66.  Note that when taking the square root you will get a positive and negative value, but since we are dealing with distance, we are only concerned with the positive result. 

## Driving distance between cities: a real world example

An application of the distance calculator is that is can be used together with the <portal cid="30">gas calculator</portal>. 

Suppose you are traveling from city A to city B and the only reference is city C, with route A to B perpendicular to route B to C. We can determine the distance from A to B. From this the gas calculator will determine fuel cost, fuel used and cost per person while traveling. 

Another common calculation used with line segments is calculating the midpoint. The is important when determining segment bisectors in geometric proofs and constructions. Calculating the midpoint involves coordinates (x₁,y₁) and (x₂,y₂), as does the distance calculator and is done simply with the <portal cid="239">midpoint calculator</portal>

The more complex version of the distance formula can be used to find <portal cid="291">the distance between coordinates in a three-dimensional coordinate system</portal>. The formula involves coordinates (x₁,y₁,z₁) and (x₂,y₂.z₂) and is √(x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)² +(z₂ - z₁)².
