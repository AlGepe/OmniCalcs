## What is distance?

Before we get to how to calculate distances, we should probably clarify what distance is. In the most typical meaning of distance it is the 1D space between two objects. This definition is one way to say what almost all of us think of distance intuitively, but it is not the only way we could talk about distance. You will see in following sections how the concept of distance can be extended beyond <portal cid=208>length</portal>. In fact, in more than one sense, that is the breakthrough behind Einstein's theory of <portal cid=751>relativity</portal>.

If we stick with the geometrical definition of distance we still have to precise what kind of space we are working on. In most cases you are probably talking about 3 dimensions or less, since that's all we can imagine without our brains exploding. For this calculator we will focus only on the 2D distance (with the 1D included as a special case). If you are looking for the 3D distance between 2 points we invite you to use our other calculator made specifically for that purpose. 

To determine the distance between two point, the first thing you need are two points, obviously. These points are described in mathematics by their coordinates in space. For each point in 2D space we need 2 coordinates. These two coordinates are unique to this point. If you wish to find the distance between two point in 1D space you can still use this calculator by simply setting one of the coordinates to be the same for both points. Since this is a very special case, from now on we will talk about distance meaning "_2D distance_".

Next step to do, if you want to be mathematical accurate and precise, is define the type of space you're working on. No, wait, don't run away! It is easier than you think. If you don't know what space you're working on or if you didn't even know there was more than one type of space, you're most likely working in Euclidean space. Since this is the "default" space in which we do almost every geometrical operations, it is the one we have set for the calculator to operate on. Let's dive a bit deeper into Euclidean spaces, what they are, what properties they have and why are so important.


## The distance formula for Euclidean distance

The Euclidean space or Euclidean geometry is precisely what we all think of space of geometry before we receive any deep mathematical training in any of these aspects. In Euclidean space the sum of <portal cid=1111>triangle angles</portal> is 180º. <portal cid=1085>Squares</portal> have all their angles equal to 90º, always... Which is something we all take for granted, but that is not true in all spaces.  Let's also not confuse Euclidean space with multidimensional spaces. Euclidean space can have as many dimensions as you want and still be Euclidean. 

We do not want to bore you with mathematical definitions of what a "_space_" is and what makes the Euclidean space unique, since that would be too complicated to explain in a simple distance calculator. However we can try to give some examples of other spaces that are commonly used and that might help you understand why Euclidean space is not the only space. Also you will hopefully understand why we are no going to bother calculating distances in other spaces.

The first example we present to you in a bit obscure, but I hope you can excuse myself as a physicist for starting with this very important type of space: "_Minkowski space_" The reason I've selected this is because it is highly used in physics, in particular in relativity theory, general relativity and even in relativistic quantum field theory. This space is very similar to Euclidean space, but differs from it in a very critical feature: <portal cid=560>dot product</portal>, also called the _inner product_ (not to be confused with the <portal cid=561>cross product</portal>).

====Below there's no paragraph, just a couple sentences to be included===

The distance formula is `√(x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²`, which relates to the <portal cid=53>Pythagorean theorem</portal>, which is `a² + b² = c²`, where `a` and `b` are legs of a right triangle and `c` is the hypotenuse. Suppose (x₁,y₁) and (x₂,y₂)are coordinates of the endpoints of the hypotenuse. Then `(x₂ - x₁)²` in the distance equation corresponds to `a²` and `(y₂ - y₁)²`corresponds to `b²`. Since `c = √a² + b²`, you can see how it is just an extension of the Pythagorean theorem.

## How to find the distance from one point to another using our distance calculator

As we have mentioned before, distance can mean many things but we focused this calculator on obtaining the distance between two points in 2-D space.  In 2-D space points are defined by two coordinates each, and that's why the distance calculator here has four text boxes for you to fill-in. Using the calculator is very straight-forward, but before you use it, we would recommend you to get acquainted with the distance formula and the procedure you would have to follow if it was 1950 and the Internet was still not a thing.

Suppose we have coordinates `(3,5) and (9,15)` and we want to calculate the distance. These would be the steps your should take to calculate the 2-D distance between these two points:

1. Input the values into the formula: `√(x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²`.
1. Subtract values in parentheses.
1. Square both quantities in parentheses.
1. Add the results.
1. Take the <portal cid="151">square root</portal>.
1. Use the distance equation to check results.

Working the example by hand, we get `√(9-3)²+(15-5)²` = `√36 + 100` = `√136`, which is approximately equal to 11.66.  Note that when taking the square root you will get a positive and negative value, but since we are dealing with distance, we are only concerned with the positive result. 

## Driving distance between cities: a real world example (to be checked and expanded)

An application of the distance calculator is that is can be used together with the <portal cid="30">gas calculator</portal>. 

Suppose you are traveling from city A to city B and the only reference is city C, with route A to B perpendicular to route B to C. We can determine the distance from A to B. From this the gas calculator will determine fuel cost, fuel used and cost per person while traveling. 

Another common calculation used with line segments is calculating the midpoint. The is important when determining segment bisectors in geometric proofs and constructions. Calculating the midpoint involves coordinates (x₁,y₁) and (x₂,y₂), as does the distance calculator and is done simply with the <portal cid="239">midpoint calculator</portal>

The more complex version of the distance formula can be used to find <portal cid="291">the distance between coordinates in a three-dimensional coordinate system</portal>. The formula involves coordinates (x₁,y₁,z₁) and (x₂,y₂.z₂) and is √(x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)² +(z₂ - z₁)².
