## What is BMI

Let's start with the basics, shall we? BMI stands for Body Mass Index and it's a 1-dimensional parameter for assessing body type/category. Depending on the BMI value one you can fall into one of three main categories: underweight, normal, overweight. There are other subcategories, but these three represent the most important groups.

If you are here you're probably trying to find an answer to the question _What is my BMI?_ For that you can use the calculator to the left of this text, or you can even calculate it yourself using the BMI formula:

`BMI = weight / heightÂ²`

As you can see, BMI is very simple to calculate which is both its strength and its biggest flaw. Since it uses only height and weight it leaves out a big amount of factors that affect the body composition of a person such as <portal cid=123>lean body mass</portal>, <portal cid=292>body fat</portal>, <portal cid=777>body water percentage</poratal>... That play a big role in correct functioning of our bodies.

## Why we need a BMI calculator for male

We have seen that the BMI formula does not include sex in any kind or form, so why, then, do we need a BMI calculator _**for men**_? The answer is that anthropomorphically adults and kids/teens are different, and even amongst adults men are women have different body characteristics. This means that we shouldn't expect the healthy BMI for men to be the same for women, and neither will the BMI charts for men and women or the BMI ranges for male and female. 

Broadly speaking, we could compare men and women together and we wouldn't be too far from the reality, but for improved precision we have decided to separate our BMI calculators into the 4 main population groups: children, teenagers, men, and women. For each of them we have a calculator ready so that you can get the best results and comparisons no matter your population group. Here is a list of the available calculators:

.) General <portal cid=81>BMI calculator </portal>
.) <portal cid=XX>BMI calculator for kids</portal>
.) <portal cid=XX>BMI calculator for teenagers</portal>
.) <portal cid=XX>BMI calculator for women</portal>
.) BMI calculator for men (this one) 

So make sure to check out the one that's relevant for you. Here we will focus only on the BMI charts for men, and all the relevant values and BMI ranges for male population only. Starting, in the next section with the different categories of bmi, why the exist and what they mean.

## World Health Organization and BMI categories

When it comes to set up the different bmi ranges for men, there are almost countless options, which is very much the reason why there are several official ways to group normal bmi in males. For the rest of the text we will adhere to the guidelines presented by the World Health Organization (WHO). The division and categorization made by WHO leads to three major bmi ranges for males (the aforementioned underweight, normal/healthy, and overweight).

However each of the categories can be subdivided to make distinctions between slight overweight and hyper obesity on one end and to distinguish slightly underweight men from severely undernourished individuals. In out calculation we use the finer of the bmi groupings, for a total of 11 different bmi ranges for men. As mentioned previously, different organizations have different ways to group values of bmi for men, but most of the thresholds are the same or at a reasonable <portal cid=144>distance</portal>.

It is important to point out that even the WHO themselves acknowledge the fact that bmi is a statistical parameter. The meaning of such statement is that having a _healthy bmi for men_ doesn't automatically mean that you are have healthy man. If you have a healthy bmi for men you are only _statistically more likely_ to be healthy than if you are outside of the normal bmi. We will talk more about the connection between bmi and health in a later section.

## BMI range for men and what the percentiles mean

It is very common when we're talking about bmi (or any statistical value, for that matter) to talk about percentiles. Percentiles are generally expressed as an ordinal number, which makes it the more confusing. To put it simply, percentiles are a quick way to compare one individual with the whole rest of the population. To understand it better let's see the procedure you should follow if you were to create your own percentile for any statistic.

First of all, you'd need to gather the data for all the people in your population group, for this calculator that would mean collection data of the bmi of men. Then you should divide the data in 100 groups according to their bmi value making sure that each group has the same number of individuals. This way you have made groups gathering 1% of the population each, also called percentiles.

Now, you are ready to classify any one individual in their percentile by simply assigning him to the corresponding groups according to his bmi. The position of his group (from lowest to highest bmi) would determine his percentile. For example if he is in the 25th group with lowest bmi, he is in the 25th percentile, which in turn means that he has a higher percentile than 25% of the population.

It is important to note that the percentiles have a fixed amount of people in each group but the bmi values for each groups are not evenly spaced. Especially at the extreme ends of the distribution a relatively big increase in bmi would result in a small change in percentile, whilst in the central values (most common bmi values) a small change in bmi can result in a big change in percentile.

Lastly (but definitely not "_leastly_") we should note that, for practical reasons, percentiles are generally grouped together so as not to have too many categories. This means that percentiles are generally clustered together in chunks of, at least 5 percentiles. What this means is that it is very rare to hear about "percentile 48th" and you're much more likely to find a jump from percentile 25th to 50th or from 5th to 10th with no mention to percentiles in between.

The reality is that this is not a big issues, especially if we consider that the percentile is a statistical comparison tool that we apply on a purely statistical descriptor such as bmi. Any precision lost in the process of reducing from having 100 percentiles to having 10 groups of 5-percentiles size is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. 

For example, in this calculator we have grouped the percentiles in 9 groups distributed as follows: 0th-5th, 5th-10th, 10th-15th, 15th-25th, 25th-50th, 50th-75th, 75th-85th, 85th-90th, 90th-95th. With the result in the calculator showing the highest percentile in the group.

## Healthy BMI prime and normal bmi

Another measure you should be familiar with is the so called **bmi prime**. bmi prime is a derived measure that compares your bmi value as a man with the normal bmi for men or the healthy bmi for men. bmi prime is also available for other populations, obviously, but since this is a bmi calculator for males, we shall focus only on the male side of bmi prime.

We have mentioned **healthy bmi for men** but we have yet to define what it is exactly; so let's do it. And... Here come the bad news: there's no biological, first principles, reason why a certain bmi is healthy and others aren't. Not all is lost, though, since the statistical origin of bmi guarantees that it will have a certain degree of accuracy for big populations, if not for individuals. 

The WHO is aware of the shortcomings of bmi as the only tool for assessing what is a <portal cid=226>ideal body weight</portal> and, hence, recommends deeper analysis for accurate diagnosis. WHO also acknowledge that bmi is only accurate for sedentary populations and not very active population, growing children or infirms.

One of the most blatantly obvious shortcomings of bmi is when it is applied to professional athletes. Due to the high percentage of <portal cid=1390>fat-free mass</portal> they carry (muscle having higher density than <portal cid=1175>body fat</portal>) most of professional athletes are "technically" overweight or even obese according to bmi. So just remember, bmi is not the be-all-and-end-all of healthy body weight, and has limited range of use.

Now that we know the limitation of bmi, and how a healthy bmi for men doesn't mean it's healthy for all men, we can now move into explaining bmi prime in depth. bmi prime is a number that results from comparing your actual bmi with the normal bmi or healthy bmi which is supposed to be around 25. By dividing your bmi by the reference value (healthy bmi for men) of 25, you obtain your _bmi prime_.

bmi prime will be a number, hopefully very close to 1, since that is the ideal number we should strive for (if we are part of the sedentary male population). A bmi prime of less than 1 represents an underweight individual whilst an overweight individual has a bmi prime bigger than 1. As with the actual bmi, there are margins of healthy weights, so don't worry if you're sedentary and have a bmi prime of 1.98, you're doing great!
