## What is BMI

Let's start with the basics, shall we? BMI stands for Body Mass Index and it's a 1-dimensional parameter for assessing body type/category. Depending on the BMI value one you can fall into one of three main categories: underweight, normal, overweight. There are other subcategories, but these three represent the most important groups.

If you are here you're probably trying to find an answer to the question _What is my BMI?_ For that you can use the calculator to the left of this text, or you can even calculate it yourself using the BMI formula:

`BMI = weight / heightÂ²`

As you can see, BMI is very simple to calculate which is both its strength and its biggest flaw. Since it uses only height and weight it leaves out a big amount of factors that affect the body composition of a person such as <portal cid=123>lean body mass</portal>, <portal cid=292>body fat</portal>, <portal cid=777>body water percentage</poratal>... That play a big role in correct functioning of our bodies.

## Why we need a BMI calculator for male

We have seen that the BMI formula does not include sex in any kind or form, so why, then, do we need a BMI calculator _**for men**_? The answer is that anthropomorphically adults and kids/teens are different, and even amongst adults men are women have different body characteristics. This means that we shouldn't expect the healthy BMI for men to be the same for women, and neither will the BMI charts for men and women or the BMI ranges for male and female. 

Broadly speaking, we could compare men and women together and we wouldn't be too far from the reality, but for improved precision we have decided to separate our BMI calculators into the 4 main population groups: children, teenagers, men, and women. For each of them we have a calculator ready so that you can get the best results and comparisons no matter your population group. Here is a list of the available calculators:

.) General <portal cid=81>BMI calculator </portal>
.) <portal cid=XX>BMI calculator for kids</portal>
.) <portal cid=XX>BMI calculator for teenagers</portal>
.) <portal cid=XX>BMI calculator for women</portal>
.) BMI calculator for men (this one) 

So make sure to check out the one that's relevant for you. Here we will focus only on the BMI charts for men, and all the relevant values and BMI ranges for male population only. Starting, in the next section with the different categories of bmi, why the exist and what they mean.

## World Health Organization and BMI categories

When it comes to set up the different bmi ranges for men, there are almost countless options, which is very much the reason why there are several official ways to group normal bmi in males. For the rest of the text we will adhere to the guidelines presented by the World Health Organization (WHO). The division and categorization made by WHO leads to three major bmi ranges for males (the aforementioned underweight, normal/healthy, and overweight).

However each of the categories can be subdivided to make distinctions between slight overweight and hyper obesity on one end and to distinguish slightly underweight men from severely undernourished individuals. In out calculation we use the finer of the bmi groupings, for a total of 11 different bmi ranges for men. As mentioned previously, different organizations have different ways to group values of bmi for men, but most of the thresholds are the same or at a reasonable <portal cid=144>distance</portal>.

It is important to point out that even the WHO themselves acknowledge the fact that bmi is a statistical parameter. The meaning of such statement is that having a _healthy bmi for men_ doesn't automatically mean that you are have healthy man. If you have a healthy bmi for men you are only _statistically more likely_ to be healthy than if you are outside of the normal bmi. We will talk more about the connection between bmi and health in a later section.
