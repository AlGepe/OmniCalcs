This is the BMI calculator for women, the tool that will **help you calculate if you have a healthy BMI for women** or an obese BMI by using the BMI calculation formula to answer the questions: "_What is my BMI?_" and "_What is good BMI for women?_". We will explain in detail all the BMI charts for women, the BMI ranges for women and explore why it is **important to keep a normal BMI** for women. So if you're interested in the BMI scale and learning more about BMI charts for females, read on; welcome to our BMI calculator for females.


## What is the BMI scale and what it measures?

Most of you reading this will already know **what is BMI**, what it stands for and probably what is a good BMI, but for those who don't (and for completeness) we will briefly explain what is BMI, how it is measured and how you can answer the question "What is my BMI?" **even without this BMI calculator for females**.

BMI stands for Body Mass Index and is a measurement of the **relationship between two of your main body metrics**: weight and height. In particular, BMI is calculated from these two variables by following the BMI calculation formula:

`BMI = weight / heightÂ²`

A crucial remark about this formula is that the units you use **DO** matter. To analyze what is a normal BMI, or establish where you place in the BMI ranges, you should **always use the metric system** and input your weight in `kg` and your height in `m`. 

Don't worry if you live in one of the few countries that still use the Imperial system, our calculator has a built-in <portal cid=208>length converter</portal> and a <portal cid=207>weight converter</portal> as we will see later. 

BMI is not a definite measurement of anything health-related, but it is a **good statistical measurement** to recognize if we should look further into our bodies and worry about health problems. BMI was never designed as a diagnostic tool and it has many flaws, about which will talk about later. However, its **simplicity makes it very convenient as a first-approach tool** to statistically determine if someone is underweight, or has an obese BMI so that you can start looking deeper at why that is and if there are any health risks associated.


## Normal BMI for women and why separate it from men.

When it comes to health and well-being we are all equally concerned; why, then, do we separate women from the rest of the population? The truth is that, despite all of us humans being equally involved in health issues, **we are not exactly the same physically**. So when we talk about health issues it is important to make a distinction between different population groups. As you will see later, it is not only about women vs men, **within each sex we will also divide into age groups** to obtain the best comparison possible.

In fact, here at Omni we have created **5 different BMI calculators**; one for each of the 4 major BMI groups (children, teenagers, women, and men) as well as a general one, for good measure. If you have landed in this calculator but don't belong in the women group, here is a list of all the BMI calculators we have made with links so that you can use the one that applies to you:

- General <portal cid=81>BMI calculator </portal>
- <portal cid=XX>BMI calculator for kids</portal>
- <portal cid=XX>BMI calculator for teenagers</portal>
- <portal cid=221>BMI calculator for men</portal>
- BMI calculator for women (_this one_) 

## What is a good BMI for women according to the WHO and their BMI categories

In the year 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a report called [Obesity: preventing and managing the global epidemic](https://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/obesity/WHO_TRS_894/en/), in page 9 of this report the present all the BMI categories recognized by WHO and their BMI ranges. We will use this as a reference from now on. We will also include other subcategories, in agreement with the WHO guidelines. This ranges can be plotted on a **BMI chart for females and males**. You can see the chart in the section below.

There is no different chart for male and female, because (amongst other reasons) **BMI is just a statistical parameter and doesn't take into account the differences in body shapes and constitution between individuals or groups**. Another way to look at it is that even though women tend to have higher levels of fat (in the healthy range) which would make them heavier, men also tend to have higher levels of muscle which could somehow balance the effect. 

Unfortunately, the reality is much more complicated than that, and this dissonance just exposes the **problem of BMI when dealing with different body types**. We will get into more detail about these problems, the validity of the values for "healthy BMI for women" and how we can asses better our body health by combining BMI with other parameters.


## BMI percentile and its relevance

We move now to the BMI percentile results that we hear about and that this calculator is able to provide. Percentile is another statistical measurement closely related to the concept of <portal cid=404>percentage</portal>. One way to understand the concept of percentiles is to think of them as percentage brackets. Technically you could **have 100 different percentiles** but typically we group them in groups of more than 1%, for simplicity. 

In this calculator, we present data in **9 percentiles distributed as follows**: 0th-5th, 5th-10th, 10th-15th, 15th-25th, 25th-50th, 50th-75th, 75th-85th, 85th-90th, 90th-95th. What each percentile tells you is how you relate to the rest of the population in your group. For this calculator we have selected the female **population of the USA and divided it into age groups of ten years** as follows: 20-29, 30-39,..., 70-79, 80+. 

What the percentile value tells you is the position you rank in terms of BMI for women amongst the rest of the USA female population. For example, if you get a result that you're in the **75th percentile that means that 75% of the female population in the USA has a BMI similar or lower than yours**. This is a comparative tool, which means it also has its drawbacks and limitations. 

So if you're taking a look at the percentile just remember that it is **skewed towards whatever condition the general population** has. For example, in the USA women (and men) tend to be overweight, so placing in the exact middle (50th percentile) is not a good sign, since probably means you're slightly overweight. Using percentiles together with absolute BMI values (or even with BMI prime for women) you can get more information about your current state. 

We have just sneakily dropped a mention about BMI prime, which is a new term. Don't worry, we won't leave you hanging, let's explain this new terms and its relevance.


## BMI chart for women and BMI prime

BMI prime is a term often mentioned in BMI articles and might seem confusing at first since it typically ranges from 0.5 to 2 while BMI itself has values between 15 and 40. However, they both strongly correlated. BMI prime is no more than the **ratio of the actual BMI to the ideal BMI for women**. The value for healthy or normal BMI for women is set to be 25, the same as for men.

The advantage of the BMI prime scale over the normal BMI scale is that, as long as you know what it means, BMI prime will not only answer the question "What is my BMI?" but it will **also answer the question "What is good BMI?" or "Is my BMI good?"** at the same time. By having a number that compares the healthy BMI for women with your actual BMI, you get double the information in just one number.

An **ideal BMI prime is around 1**, which corresponds to a BMI of 25. The margins are narrow, since we are talking about small numbers so, even if 1.5 sounds like close enough to 1, it corresponds to a BMI of 37.5, which means you have "_Obese Class II_" or "_Severly obese_" according to the BMI categories made by WHO.

Another way to compare your BMI and **determine if you have a healthy BMI**, or at least a normal BMI, is to look at a BMI chart for women. Here you can see a picture of the BMI chart for females and males. It is conveniently color-coded to separate the regions of healthy BMI from those that are risky, from the very dangerous ones. They way you should use this BMI chart is the following:
<img></img>

1. Find where your BMI is located in the BMI chart for women. You can use either the calculated BMI or your weight and height.
1. With the help of the legend and the colors in the chart, asses how healthy is your BMI.
1. If necessary devise a plan to change your BMI to healthier levels. (If it's already healthy: Congratulations!)

We have mentioned that you should calculate your BMI as female as the first step, and we show you the BMI calculation formula to do that by hand. However, we haven't really told you how to do that **using our BMI calculator for women**, so let's take a closer look at that now.

## How to use and interpret the BMI for women calculator 

Whether you have read all the text above or just jumped into this section to use the BMI calculator for females, we will teach now the basic operation of the calculator and the meaning of its results. First things first, let's see how you can answer the question " what is my BMI?" using our calculator:

1. Input your height; BMI is calculated using `m` but you can use any units and the calculator will convert them for you
1. Input your weight; as for the height, the BMI calculator for women will convert into the right units for you.
1. You will get the results for your BMI and BMI prime automatically. As well as your WHO BMI category. If that's all you care about, you're done.
1. Input your age, in years.
1. Your percentile will be computed and shown. Remember this is calculated using the USA female population. 

Now you have your results, so it's time for interpreting them and seeing what they mean. Let's start with the BMI prime and BMI scales. Since they are strongly correlated, **it suffices to look at one of them, but we show both so that you can choose your favorite**. Let's say you got a BMI of 29. It will show as "Overweight", with a BMI prime of 1.16.

Theoretically, this means that you have a little extra weight that you should get rid of to get to your <portal cid=226>ideal weight</portal>, but before you go rushing to start a diet think closely. First of all, where is that extra weight coming from? Is it <portal cid=292>body fat</portal>, is it <portal cid=123>lean mass</portal> or maybe it's just <portal cid=777>water</portal> in your body... Answering these questions correctly is very important and can be tricky; as a starting point, we recommend you use our calculators. 

Next up we need to understand the percentile you placed in. Assuming you are 35 years old, your percentile will show as "75th", this means that 75% of the USA female population in the age range of 30-39 has a lower BMI than you do. This is generally an indicator of whether things are right or wrong, but as with all things BMI, it's definitive. 


## Healthy BMI for women: how bad is to be in the obese BMI range?

We will show now some data from a correlational study between BMI for women and mortality rate. As we can see, there is a strong correlation between not ideal BMI for women and mortality rate. Does that mean that unhealthy BMI kill? Well, we cannot know for sure, since **correlation doesn't imply causation** but it would seem that it is much safer to have a normal BMI for women, which shouldn't surprise anyone.

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/WomenBMIMort.png

What is a bit more surprising is the strong correlation at **slightly unhealthy BMI**. It could be totally possible that slightly high BMI causes a higher risk of death, but given the variations in BMI due to many different factors, there's another explanation that seems more plausible. BMI is an indicator that works both ways: women with normal BMI tend to be healthy, and healthy females tend to have normal BMI. 

For example, **as we age our metabolisms degrade and it becomes much easier to put on weight than it was before**. If you think about it, it's much harder to find an old person that has a healthy weight, people tend to be overweight or underweight as they grow past their younger years. In any case, it is much better to play it safe and try to stay in an ideal (or somewhat healthy) BMI range for women, since **there's nothing to win by having extreme BMI values, and there's a lot to lose**.


## Differences between male and female BMI percentile

It is time now to take a look at the **differences in BMI between men and women**, beyond the body composition that we have mentioned before. The first thing to mention is the differences in <portal cid=566>body type</portal>, not only between men and women but also within those groups. If you look a all the men in the world their general body shape doesn't really vary that much, except for the proportion of fat and muscle. 

However, if you look at women, **their body shapes change dramatically, even between people with the same proportions of body fat and muscle**. The size of the bust, the shape, and proportion between hips and waist... Even women's legs tend to differ much more from one female to another than they do for men. What does this mean for BMI charts for women? It means a big disparity.

If we look at the BMI ranges for women they are the same as for men because those are **made in a purely theoretical way**. If instead, you look at the percentile BMI ranges... The story changes a lot. The spread of BMI values in women is much greater than that of men. Let's look at an example to understand this better.

If we look at **the values for the 5th and 95th percentiles of BMI for women and compare them to men**, we will see something surprising. Across all age groups, the **5th percentile limit is lower for women** than for men but, at the same time, the **95th percentile limit is also higher for women**. So the distribution of BMI for women is not biased towards higher BMI or lower BMI, it is more evenly distributed than for men.

What this means is that if we look at the extreme values of BMI ranges, there are **proportionally more women than men on those extremes**. There are two possible reasons for this, and likely they are both at play with their effects combining. First of all, it could be due to this differences in body shapes which would mean more women than men have bodies for which a healthy BMI is higher or lower than the "normal BMI" for women currently set at 25.

The other possibility comes from societal pressure. It is unarguable that **women are treated differently than men in our society**, from <portal cid=1331>gender pay gap</portal> to physical appearances. And is this physical appearance pressure that could possibly be at **the root of these extreme cases**. Some women pathologically try to get an **'ideal weight' that is far too low** for it to be healthy, while others might feel like this is all a big lie and there is nothing wrong with having an obese BMI. Both approaches are seriously dangerous, life-threatening even. So we need to grow as a society towards a **more educated take on body weight where health is above looks or unattainable (fake) standards of beauty**.
