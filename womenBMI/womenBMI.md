## What is BMI and what it measures?

Most of you reading this will already know what is bmi, what it stands for and probably what is a good bmi, but for those who don't (and for completeness) we will briefly explain what is bmi, how it is measured and how you can answer the question "What is my bmi?" even without this bmi calculator for females.

bmi stands for Body Mass Index, and is a measurement of the relationship between two of your main body metrics: weight and height. In particular bmi is calculated from these two variables by following this simple formula:

`BMI = weight / heightÂ²`

A crucial remark about this formula is that the units you use DO matter. The bmi formula works with any units you input but to be able to analyze what is a normal bmi, of establish where you place in the bmi ranges, you should always use the metric system and input your weight in `kg` and your height in `m`. 

Don't worry if you live in one of the few countries that still uses the Imperial system, our calculator has a built in <portal cid=208>length converter</portal> and a <portal cid=207>weight converter</portal> as we will see later. 

bmi is not a definite measurement of anything health-related, but it is a good statistical measurement to recognize if we should look further into our bodies and worry about health problems. bmi was never designed as a diagnostic tool and it has many flaws, about which will talk about later. However, its simplicity makes it very convenient as a first approach tool to statistically determine if someone is underweight, or has an obese bmi so that we can start looking deeper at why that is and if there are any health risks associated.


## Why we separate women BMI from other populations

When it comes to health and well-being we are all equally concerned; why, then, do we separate women from the rest of the population? The truth is that, despite all of us humans being equally involved in health issues, we are not exactly the same physically. So when we talk about health issues it is important to make distinction between different population groups. As you will see later, it is not only about women vs men, within each group we will also divide in age groups in search for the best comparison possible.

In fact, here at Omni we have created 5 different BMI calculators; one for each of the 4 major bmi groups (children, teenagers, women and men) as well as a general one, for good measure. If you have landed in this calculator but don't belong in the women group, here is a list of all the bmi calculators we have made with links, so that you can use the one that applies to you:

- General <portal cid=81>BMI calculator </portal>
- <portal cid=XX>BMI calculator for kids</portal>
- <portal cid=XX>BMI calculator for teenagers</portal>
- <portal cid=221>BMI calculator for men</portal>
- BMI calculator for women (_this one_) 

From now on we will talk only about BMI for women including what is a healthy bmi for women, what we can learn form the bmi charts for women, etc. We welcome anyone to read ahead (knowledge knows no population groups) but you should be aware that we will focus on the specifics of bmi related to women; after all this is called "bmi calculator for women" for a reason.

## World Health Organization and BMI categories for women

Now that the introductory parts are done and dusted, let's take a look at the bmi ranges for women and what is a good bmi for women to have. Since bmi is merely a statistical tool, there are many ways to establish a healthy bmi for women and all the different bmi ranges. We will focus here on the bmi chart for women and men made by the WHO and its respective bmi scales.

In the year 2000, the WHO published a report called [Obesity: preventing and managing the global epidemic](https://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/obesity/WHO_TRS_894/en/), in page 9 of this report the present all the bmi categories recognised by WHO and their bmi ranges. We will use this as reference from now on. We will also include other subcategories, in agreement with the WHO guidelines. This ranges can be plotted on a bmi chart for females and males. You can see the chart in between the lines that compose this section. 

We should bring you attention to the fact that there is no distinct bmi chart for women and for men neither in the report, nor in our plot. This rises questions about the validity of this bmi ranges and the bmi categories for women and men, and for good reason: male and female bodies are physically very different. 

The easiest way to explain this is to remember that bmi is just a statistical parameter and doesn't take into account the differences in body shapes and constitution between individuals or groups. Another way to look at it is that even though women tend to have higher levels of fat (in the healthy range) which would make them heavier, men also tend to have higher levels of muscle which could somehow balance the effect. 

Unfortunately the reality is much more complex than that and this dissonance just exposes the problem of bmi when dealing with different body types. We will get into more detail about this problems, the validity of the values for "healthy bmi for women" and how we can asses better our body health by combining bmi with other parameters.
