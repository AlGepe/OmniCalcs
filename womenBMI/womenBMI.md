## What is BMI and what it measures?

Most of you reading this will already know what is bmi, what it stands for and probably what is a good bmi, but for those who don't (and for completeness) we will briefly explain what is bmi, how it is measured and how you can answer the question "What is my bmi?" even without this bmi calculator for females.

bmi stands for Body Mass Index, and is a measurement of the relationship between two of your main body metrics: weight and height. In particular bmi is calculated from these two variables by following this simple formula:

`BMI = weight / heightÂ²`

A crucial remark about this formula is that the units you use DO matter. The bmi formula works with any units you input but to be able to analyze what is a normal bmi, of establish where you place in the bmi ranges, you should always use the metric system and input your weight in `kg` and your height in `m`. 

Don't worry if you live in one of the few countries that still uses the Imperial system, our calculator has a built in <portal cid=208>length converter</portal> and a <portal cid=207>weight converter</portal> as we will see later. 

bmi is not a definite measurement of anything health-related, but it is a good statistical measurement to recognize if we should look further into our bodies and worry about health problems. bmi was never designed as a diagnostic tool and it has many flaws, about which will talk about later. However, its simplicity makes it very convenient as a first approach tool to statistically determine if someone is underweight, or has an obese bmi so that we can start looking deeper at why that is and if there are any health risks associated.


## Why we separate women BMI from other populations

When it comes to health and well-being we are all equally concerned; why, then, do we separate women from the rest of the population? The truth is that, despite all of us humans being equally involved in health issues, we are not exactly the same physically. So when we talk about health issues it is important to make distinction between different population groups. As you will see later, it is not only about women vs men, within each group we will also divide in age groups in search for the best comparison possible.

In fact, here at Omni we have created 5 different BMI calculators; one for each of the 4 major bmi groups (children, teenagers, women and men) as well as a general one, for good measure. If you have landed in this calculator but don't belong in the women group, here is a list of all the bmi calculators we have made with links, so that you can use the one that applies to you:

- General <portal cid=81>BMI calculator </portal>
- <portal cid=XX>BMI calculator for kids</portal>
- <portal cid=XX>BMI calculator for teenagers</portal>
- <portal cid=221>BMI calculator for men</portal>
- BMI calculator for women (_this one_) 

From now on we will talk only about BMI for women including what is a healthy bmi for women, what we can learn form the bmi charts for women, etc. We welcome anyone to read ahead (knowledge knows no population groups) but you should be aware that we will focus on the specifics of bmi related to women; after all this is called "bmi calculator for women" for a reason.

## World Health Organization and BMI categories for women

Now that the introductory parts are done and dusted, let's take a look at the bmi ranges for women and what is a good bmi for women to have. Since bmi is merely a statistical tool, there are many ways to establish a healthy bmi for women and all the different bmi ranges. We will focus here on the bmi chart for women and men made by the WHO and its respective bmi scales.

In the year 2000, the WHO published a report called [Obesity: preventing and managing the global epidemic](https://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/obesity/WHO_TRS_894/en/), in page 9 of this report the present all the bmi categories recognised by WHO and their bmi ranges. We will use this as reference from now on. We will also include other subcategories, in agreement with the WHO guidelines. This ranges can be plotted on a bmi chart for females and males. You can see the chart in between the lines that compose this section. 

We should bring you attention to the fact that there is no distinct bmi chart for women and for men neither in the report, nor in our plot. This rises questions about the validity of this bmi ranges and the bmi categories for women and men, and for good reason: male and female bodies are physically very different. 

The easiest way to explain this is to remember that bmi is just a statistical parameter and doesn't take into account the differences in body shapes and constitution between individuals or groups. Another way to look at it is that even though women tend to have higher levels of fat (in the healthy range) which would make them heavier, men also tend to have higher levels of muscle which could somehow balance the effect. 

Unfortunately the reality is much more complex than that and this dissonance just exposes the problem of bmi when dealing with different body types. We will get into more detail about this problems, the validity of the values for "healthy bmi for women" and how we can asses better our body health by combining bmi with other parameters.

## BMI percentile and its relevance

We move now to the bmi percentile results that we hear about and that this calculator is able to provide. Percentile is a statistical measurement closely related to the concept of <portal cid=404>percentage</portal>. One way to understand the concept of percentiles is to think of them as percentage brackets. Technically you could have 100 different percentiles but typically we group them in groups of more than 1%, for simplicity. 

In this calculator we present data in 9 percentiles distributed as follows: 0th-5th, 5th-10th, 10th-15th, 15th-25th, 25th-50th, 50th-75th, 75th-85th, 85th-90th, 90th-95th. What each percentile tells you is how you relate to the rest of the population in your group. For this calculator we have selected the female population of the USA and divided it in age groups of ten years as follows: 20-29, 30-39,..., 70-79, 80+. 

What the percentile tells you is the position you rank in terms of bmi for women amongst the rest of the USA female population. For example, if you get a result that you're in the 75th percentile that means that 75% of the female population in the USA has a bmi similar or lower than yours. This is a comparative tool, which means it also has its drawbacks and limitations. 

So if you're taking a look at the percentile just remember that it is skewed towards whatever condition the general population has. For example, in the USA women (and men) tend to be overweight, to placing in the exact middle (50th percentile) is not a good sign, since probably means you're slightly overweight. Using percentiles together with absolute bmi values (or even with bmi prime for women) you can get more information about your current state. 

We have just sneakily dropped a mention about bmi prime, which is a new term. Don't worry, we won't leave you hanging, let's explain this new terms and its relevance.

## BMI chart for women and BMI prime

BMI prime is a term often mentioned in bmi articles, and might seem confusing at first since it typically ranges from 0.5 to 2 while bmi itself has values between 15 and 40. However, they both strongly correlated. bmi prime is no more than the ratio of the actual bmi to the healthy bmi for women. The value for healthy or normal bmi for women is set to be 25,the same as for men. Whether having both normal bmi for women and men be the same is a subject of debate.

The advantage of bmi prime over bmi is that, as long as you know what it means, bmi prime will no only answer the question "What is my bmi?" but it will also answer the question "What is good bmi?" or "Is my bmi good?" at the same time. By having a number that compares the healthy bmi for women with your actual bmi, you get double the information in just one number.

So, once you have your bmi prime, you can immediately know how healthy it is. An idea bmi prime is around 1, which corresponds to a bmi of 25. The margins are narrow, since we are talking about small numbers so, even if 1.5 sounds like close enough to 1, it corresponds to a bmi of 37.5, which means you have "_Obese Class II_" or "_Severly obese_" according to the bmi categories made by WHO.

Another way to compare your bmi and determine if you have a healthy bmi, or at least a normal bmi, is to look at a bmi chart for women. Once again the WHO does not really distinguish bmi charts for females and bmi charts for males, but we will get into what issues that might bring in a later section. For now let's just focus on comparing our bmi. 

Here you can see a picture of the bmi chart for females and males. It is conveniently color-coded to separate the regions of healthy bmi from those that are risky, from the ones that are very dangerous. They way you should use this bmi chart is the following:

1. Find where your bmi is located in the chart either with the calculated bmi or by finding your weight and height.
1. With help of the legend and the colors in the chart, asses how healthy is you bmi.
1. If necessary devise a plan to change your bmi to healthier levels. (If it's already healthy: Congratulations!)

We have mentioned that you should calculate your bmi as female as the first step, but we haven't really told you how to do that using our bmi calculator for women, so let's take a closer look at that now.

## How to use and interpret the BMI for women calculator 

Whether you have read all the text above or just jumped into this section to use the bmi calculator for women, we will teach now the basic operation of the calculator and the meaning of its results. First things first, let's see how you can answer the question " what is my bmi?" using our calculator:

1. Input your height; BMI is calculated using `m` but you can use any units and the calculator will convert them for you
1. Input you weight; as for the height, the bmi calculator for women will convert into the right units for you.
1. You will get the results for you bmi and bmi prime automatically. As well as your WHO bmi category. If that's all you care about, you're done.
1. Input your age, in years.
1. Your percentile will be computed and shown. Remember this is calculated using the USA female population. 

Now you have your results, so it's time for interpreting them and seeing what they mean. Let's start with the bmi and bmi prime values. Since they are strongly correlated it suffices to look at one of them, but we show both so that you can chose your favourite. Let's say you got a bmi of 29. It will show as "Overweight", with a bmi prime of 1.16.

Theoretically this means that you have a little extra weight that you should get rid of to get to your <portal cid=226>ideal weight</portal>, but before you go rushing to start a diet think closely. First of all, where is that extra weight coming from? Is it <portal cid=292>body fat</portal>, is it <portal cid=123>lean mass</portal> or maybe it's just <portal cid=777>water</portal> in your body... Answering this questions correctly is very important and can be tricky; as a starting point we recommend you use our calculators. 

Once you know what is the source of your "extra" weight, you can make a decision about staying how you are (if it's muscle of water) or starting a healthy diet (if it's unhealthy extra fat). Keep in mind that bones also vary a lot in weight so the can also contribute to a higher bmi range. Next up we need to understand the percentile you placed in.

Assuming you are 35 years old, your percentile will show as "75th", this means that 75% of the USA female population in the age range of 30-39 has a lower bmi than you do. This is generally and indicator of whether things are right or wrong, but as with all things bmi, it's definitive. Once again you might be an elite athlete full of muscle or you could simple be retaining a lot of liquids, and that would be the answer to why your bmi is so high.

## Healthy BMI ranges for women: how critical are they?

We have mentioned extensively the possible theoretical flaws of bmi as a measurement of what constitutes a healthy bmi for women, however we have never contrasted it with data; it's time to do that. The data we will show now is a correlational study between bmi for women and mortality rate. Let's take a look at the data and then analyse what might be going on there.

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/WomenBMIMort.png

As we can see there is a strong correlation between unhealthy bmi for women and mortality rate. Does that mean that unhealthy bmi kill? Well we cannot know for sure, since **correlation doesn't mean causation** but it would seem that it is much safer to have a normal bmi for women. It is fairly clear why extremes have very high mortality risk. If you have an extremely low weight your body is incapable of sustaining itself and you'd be very weak to defend yourself against any external factors. 

Equally bad is being extremely obese since that means huge levels of body fat. These incredible amount of fat not only limits your performance in sports buy also covers your organs, clogs your vascular system and greatly increases the risk of suffering heart problems. So the extremes are clear, what is not so clear is why there is such a big difference between the middle bmi ranges for women, those that while not being healthy bmi for women, are also not outrageously dangerous.

It could be totally possible that slightly high bmi causes higher risk of death, but given the variations in bmi due to many different factors there's another explanation that seems more plausible. bmi is an indicator that works both ways: women with normal bmi tend to be healthy, and healthy females tend to have normal bmi. For example, as we age our metabolisms degrade and it becomes much easier to put on weight than it was before. If you think about it, it's much harder to find an old person that has a healthy weight, people tend to be overweight or underweight as the grow pass their younger years. 

In any case is much better to play it safe and try to stay in a healthy or somewhat healthy bmi range for women, since there's nothing to win buy having extreme bmi values, and there's a lot to lose.

## Differences between male and female BMI percentile

It is time now to take a look at the differences in bmi between men and women, beyond the body composition that we have mentioned before. The first thing to mention is the differences in body shapes, not only between men and women, but also within those groups. If you look a all the men in the world their general body shape doesn't really vary that much, except for the proportion of fat and muscle. 

However, if you look at women, they're body shapes change dramatically, even between people with same proportions of body fat and muscle. The size of the bust, the shape and proportion between hips and waist... Even women's legs tend to differ much more from one female to another than they do for men. What does this mean for bmi charts for women? It mean big disparity.

If we look at the bmi ranges for women they are the same as for men, because those are made in a purely theoretical way. If instead you look at the percentile bmi ranges... The story changes a lot. The spread of bmi values in women is much greater than that of men. Let's look at an example to understand this better.

If we look at the values for the 5th and 95th percentiles of bmi for women and compare them to men, we will see something surprinsing. Across all age groups the 5th percentile limit is lower for women than for men but, at the same time, the 95th percentile limit is also higher for women. So the distribution of bmi for women is not biased towards higher bmi or lower bmi, it is more evenly distributed than for men.

What this means is that if we look at the extreme values of bmi ranges, there is proportionally more women than men on those extremes. There are two possible reasons for this, and likely they are both at play with their effects combining. First of all, first of all it could be due to this differences in body shapes which would mean more women than men have bodies for which a healthy bmi is higher or lower than the "normal bmi" for women currently set at 25.

The other possibility comes from societal pressure. It is unarguable that women are treated differently than men in our society, from <portal cid=1331>gender pay gap</portal> to physical appearances. And is this physical appearance pressure that could possibly be at the root of these extreme cases with some women pathologically trying to get an 'ideal weight' that is far too low for it to be healthy, while others might feel like this is all a big lie and there is nothing wrong with being obese. Both approaches are seriously dangerous, life threatening even. So we need to grow as a society towards a more educate take on body weight where health is above looks, or unattainable (fake) standards of beauty.
