Before the orbital period calculator was available, calculating the orbital period of a binary star system or other plants seemed daunting, not to speak about learning about Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Now you don't need to know about Kepler's third law, elliptical orbits or orbital period equations, simply put the numbers and get the result. We will also teach you about geostationary orbit, low Earth orbit, and geosynchronous orbits as well as Johannes Kepler and all his contributions to deciphering planet's orbits in our solar system.

## Orbit definition and what is the orbital period

When we talk about orbits, it is very clear that we're already in the realm of astronomy and celestial objects. In this context, the meaning of orbits is clearly defined as the path that a body follows in their movement around a different object. For example, Earth's orbit around the Sun is the path that our precious planet traverses around the Sun every year. 

But not every planet takes a year, that is 365 days, to go around the Sun. And this gets even more complicated if we don't look at the Sun but for example at the Moon's orbit. Here is where the concept of orbital period needs to be introduced and the question _" what is the orbital period?"_ needs to be answered. Luckily for us, the answer is very simple: the orbital period is the time it takes to move completely around the central object you are orbiting, or in other words, the time it takes to go once around the orbit.

The only problem now is to calculate such period for any two objects orbiting one another. In general, this process is not straight forward and involves using the <portal cid=438>gravitational force</portal> that one object exerts on the other and solving all the equations. Luckily for us, Johannes Kepler did all of this using Newton's approximations and arrived at a very easy result. Now, all we have to do is use that orbital period equation and obtain the results quickly.

## Johannes Kepler's laws planetary motion and elliptical orbits

Johannes Kepler was a very famous German astronomer in the 17th Century. One of his most significant contributions to astronomy is what we now call **the three Kepler's laws of planetary motion**. These three laws summarise perfectly how planets revolve around stars and can predict the planets orbits and orbital periods with an accuracy unheard of at the time. He did all of this by using (among other tricks) elliptical orbits, instead of the circular orbits used at the time.

To get more information on each of the three Kepler's laws of planetary motion we recommend checking out our <portal cid=1018>orbital velocity calculator</portal> where they are explained in detail, especially Kepler's third law. Here we will, nonetheless, explain briefly what each of them means.

The first of Kepler's laws of planetary motion states that the orbits of planets around the sun are <portal cid=568>ellipses</portal> with the Sun at one of the foci. This is a big departure from the previous theories that located the Sun in the center of a circumference/sphere that would dictate the movement of the planets. It's interesting to note, though, that if we consider that a <portal cid=288>circumference</portal> is an ellipse with eccentricity 0 (zero), Kepler's laws of planetary motion reduce to the old laws about circles and circumferences.

The second of these laws states that for similar periods of time the of the ellipse corresponding to the movement of the planet is the same. This is best seen in the picture that accompanies this text, but one of the striking implications is that the closer a planet is to the Sun, the faster the <portal cid=213>speed</portal> with which it moves. This is observed not only for planets but most significantly for comets and other bodies orbiting the Sun.

We arrive at Kepler's third law which is the most practical one since not only does it provide the orbital period equation but also tells us how to calculate the orbital period of a planet. Kepler's 3rd law states that the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit it follows around the sun. The constant of proportionality can be either calculated theoretically or discovered experimentally. This is the point where we can prove that Kepler's laws of planetary motion (in particular Kepler's third law) are compatible with Newton's laws of gravitation.  

## Types of orbits: what is low Earth orbit and what is a binary star system

Kepler's laws describe specifically the movement of planets around the Sun or any other star for that matter. However, with a bit of mathematical <strike>magic</strike> skills, we can extend them to any system of two bodies orbiting each other. Two extreme examples of this are the low Earth orbit and binary star systems. Let's see how each of these differ from the star-planet system.

First, let's establish what the low Earth orbit is. The low Earth orbit is an orbit very close to the surface of the Earth were satellites can move around the Earth without falling into it. This low Earth orbit is so close to the surface of the Earth compared to the size of the planet that we can consider the satellite to be orbiting just on its surface.

This approximation, and the fact the Earth is effectively infinitely more massive than the satellite allows us to make some approximations. These approximations simplify the equations of motion so much that we can calculate the orbital period with only the density of the central mass, in this case, the Earth. This approximation, and hence its resulting equation, can be used for any small body orbiting a massive central body very close to its surface.

Moving onto what is a binary star system, we find pretty much the opposite situation to the low Earth orbit. For those still asking what is a binary star system, we should clarify: a binary star system is such system where two stars are so close to each other and such similar masses that both stars orbit each other without a clear central body. One could see this system as a more democratic system compared to the master-slave relationship that we find in the solar system where the Sun effectively stands still while the rest of the planets orbit around it.

In the case of the binary star system, we still have elliptical orbits, but the difference is that the focus of the ellipse described by each star's orbit is somewhere between them. In this case, we can pretend that one of them is still (using it as the point of reference for our frame of reference) and calculate the orbital period of the other by using simple equations. 

But..."_How to calculate the orbital period in these extreme cases?_" - I here you ask-. Don't fret! For we have the perfect tool for your astronomical needs: **The orbital period calculator from OmniCalculator**. Let's now see how you can make use of this fantastic tool to calculate orbital periods of binary systems and small satellites without breaking a sweat.

## Orbital period calculator and how many satellites orbit the Earth

If you turn your attention to the calculator itself you will see that it has two distinct parts: one labeled "_Satellite around central body_" and the second one aptly named "_Binary system_". For this first part, we will focus on the first one, which will help us calculate orbital periods for small satellites orbiting on the low Earth orbits.

In this section, we have only to fields to fill, so it will be easy. In fact, you only need to fill one of the fields for the calculator to work. As we mentioned before, you only need to know the density of the central body to obtain the orbital period of the small satellite orbiting around it. The equation we're using in this approximation is a very simple one: 

`T = √(3 * π / G * ρ)`
Where `T` is the orbital period, `G` is the universal gravitational constant and `ρ` is the density of the central body. We can use this simple equation to calculate the orbital period of any satellite around any planet. For example, in the case of the Earth, the density is `5.51g/cm³` which would give a period of `58.6 days`.

It is important to remember that as we move away from the surface of the Earth (or the central body) this approximation falls off. This is clearly visible when we consider that different satellites have different orbital periods. This gives rise to orbits like the geostationary orbit and geosynchronous orbits. These orbits are such that have an orbital period of exactly `1day = 23.934446hours`. The difference between the geostationary orbit and the geosynchronous orbit is the position with respect to the equator. The geostationary orbit is exactly above the equator and therefore the satellites in this orbit stay all over the said point on Earth's surface. The geosynchronous orbit, however, is located anywhere and does not have a one to one mapping of any particular point on Earth.

You are probably wondering how many satellites orbit the Earth currently... And we have the answer. Space debris is a big problem due to how many satellites orbit the Earth at the moment, and the number is only increasing. Nowadays is becoming such a problem that space agencies are starting to consider possible solutions to be implemented in the near future. But enough rambling, let's give you the figure; just how many satellites orbit the Earth? The latest statistics point at over 3700 satellites orbiting the Earth right now, of which only about 1100 are operative... Let's hope gravity doesn't stop working and those satellites never fall on our heads!

## How to calculate the orbital period of a binary star system

We now should move to binary star systems. We have already seen what is the binary star definition, namely, a system made of 2 stars of similar size orbiting each other, so it's now time to calculate their orbital period. For such purpose, we have made the second part of the orbital period calculator. In this space we have several variables: 

* **Mass 1**: The mass of the first star, also named `M1`
* **Mass 2**: The mass of the first star, also named `M2`
* **Semi-axis**: The semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit with one star in the focus. We'll call it `a`
* **T binary**: Orbital period of the binary star system, also called `Tbinary`

Remember that **mass is referred to as <portal cid=207>weight</portal> in everyday life**. 

The orbital period equation ruling this system is the following: `Tbinary = 2*π * √(a³/G*(M1+M2))` where once again `G` is the universal gravitation constant. Note that for both parts of the calculator `G` can be changed by using the advanced options.

This equation is not limited to systems that comply fully with the binary star definition, it can be extended to any binary system. One such example is the Pluto-Charon system; none of the objects are stars (not even planets) and hence do no fulfill the binary star definition, but yet they are a binary system of which we can compute the orbital period using our orbital period calculator.

In fact, this binary star/system calculation is a much better approximation and could be extended to systems that wouldn't typically be considered binary systems. For example, if we take the Sun and the Earth, we could still obtain reasonable results if we consider them a binary system. By inputting `M1= 1Sun`, `M2= 1Earth` and setting the `a = 1au` the mean <portal cid=144>distance</portal> between Sun and Earth we obtain an orbital period of `Tbinary = 365.2days` which is `1year` almost to the minute.
