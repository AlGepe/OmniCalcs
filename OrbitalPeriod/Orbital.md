## Orbit definition and what is the orbital period

When we talk about orbits, it is very clear that we're already in the realm of astronomy and celestial objects. In this context the meaning of orbits is clearly defined as the path that a body follows in their movement around a different object. For example, Earth's orbit around the Sun is the path that our precious planet traverses around the Sun every year. 

But not every planet takes a year, that is 365 days, to go around the Sun. And this get even more complicated if we don't look at the Sun but for example at the Moon's orbit. Here is where the concept of orbital period needs to be introduced and the question _"what is the orbital period?"_ needs to be answered. Luckily for us, the answer is very simple: the orbital period is the time it takes to move completely around the central object you are orbiting, or in other words, the time it takes to go once around the orbit.

The only problem now is to calculate such period for any two objects orbiting one another. In general this process is not straight forward and involves using the <portal cid=438>gravitational force</portal> that one object exerts on the other and solving all the equations. Luckily for us, Johaness Kepler did all of this using Newton's approximations and arrived at a very easy result. Now all we have to do is use that orbital period equation and obtain the results quickly.

## Johannes Kepler's laws planetary motion and elliptical orbits

Johannes Kepler was a very famous German astronomer in the 17th Century. One of his biggest contributions to astronomy is what we now call **the three Kepler's laws of planetary motion**. These three laws summarise perfectly how planets revolve around stars and can predict the planets orbits and orbital periods with an accuracy unheard of at the time. He did all of this by using (among other tricks) elliptical orbits, instead of the circular orbits used at the time.

To get more information on each of the three Kepler's laws of planetary motion we recommend checking out our <portal cid=1018>orbital velocity calculator</portal> where they are explained in detail, specially Kepler's third law. Here we will, nonetheless, explain briefly what each of them mean.

The first of Kepler's laws of planetary motion states that the orbits of planets around the sun are ellipses with the Sun at one of the foci. This is a big departure from the previous theories that located the Sun in the center of a circumference/sphere that would dictate the movement of the planets. It's interesting to note, though, that if we consider that a circumference is an ellipse with eccentricity 0 (zero), Kepler's laws of planetary motion reduce to the old laws about circles and circumferences.

The second of these laws states that for similar periods of time the of the ellipse corresponding to the movement of the planet is the same. This is best seen in the picture that accompanies this text, but one of the striking implications is that the closer a planet is to the Sun, the faster it moves. This is observed not only for planets, but most significantly for comets and other bodies orbiting the Sun.

We arrive at Kepler's third law which is the most practical one since not only does it provide the orbital period equation but also tells us how to calculate the orbital period of a planet. Kepler's 3rd law states that the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit it follows around the sun. The constant of proportionality can be either calculated theoretically or discovered experimentally. This is the point where we can prove that Kepler's laws of planetary motion (in particular Kepler's third law) are compatible with Newton's laws of gravitation.  

## Types of orbits: what is low Earth orbit and what is a binary star systems

Kepler's laws describe specifically the movement of planets around the Sun, or any other star for that matter. However with a bit of mathematical <strike>magic</strike> skills we can extend them to any system of two bodies orbiting each other. Two extreme examples of this are the low Earth orbit and binary star systems. Let's see how each of these differ from the star-planet system.

First let's stablish what is the low Earth orbit. The low Earth orbit is an orbit very close to the surface of the Earth were satellites can move around the Earth without falling into it. This low Earth orbit is so close to the surface of the Earth compared to the size of the planet that we can consider the satellite to be orbiting just on its surface.

This approximation, and the fact the Earth is effectively infinitely more massive than the satellite allows us to make some approximations. These approximations simplify the equations of motion so much that we can calculate the orbital period with only the density of the central mass, in this case the Earth. This approximation, and hence its resulting equation, can be used for any small body orbiting a massive central body very close to its surface.

Moving onto what is a binary star system, we find pretty much the opposite situation to the low Earth orbit. For those still asking what is a binary star system we should clarify: a binary star system is such system where two stars are so close to each other and such similar masses that both stars orbit each other without a clear central body. One could see this system as a more democratic system compared to the master-slave relationship that we find in the solar system where the Sun effectively stands still while the rest of the planets orbit around it.

In the case of binary star system we still have elliptical orbits, but the difference is that the focus of the ellipse described by each star's orbit is somewhere between them. In this case we can pretend that one of them is still (using it as the point of reference for our frame of reference) and calculate the orbital period of the other by using simple equations. 

But..."_How to calculate the orbital period in these extreme cases?_" - I here you ask-. Don't fret! For we have the perfect tool for your astronomical needs: **The orbital period calculator from OmniCalculator**. Let's now see how you can make use of this amazing tool to calculate orbital periods of binary systems and small satellites without breaking a sweat.

## Orbital period calculator and how many satellites orbit the Earth

If you turn your attention to the calculator itself you will see that it has two distinct parts: one labelled "_Satellite around central body_" and the second one aptly named "_Binery systema_". For this first part we will focus on the first one, which will help us calculate orbital periods for small satellites orbiting on the low Earth orbits.
