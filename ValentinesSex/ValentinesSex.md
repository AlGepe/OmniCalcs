## 1 Valentine's day, celebrate the love

As Valentine's day approaches, people start to plan how to celebrate their love and give way to their passions and desires. There is, however, one question many will have: "_What did Saint Valentine have to do with love?_". As with many Christian celebrations, there is a distant pagan origin to it. 

Such origin appears to be the Roman celebration of Lupercalia, a festivity around female fertility in which a dog and a goat would be sacrificed. Since apparently these sacrifices alone would not guarantee that women would be fertile, they would then whip them with pieces of skin from the slain animals. Moreover, this celebration included a match-making lottery in which young couples would be randomly united for at least the duration of Lupercalia, in a crude version of the modern "First Date". 

But then, surprising no one, the Catholic church banned Lupercalia. In 5th Century pope Gelasius I, decided to incorporate Lupercalia into the already Christian Valentine's Day. This adulteration of such a seemingly joyful (albeit obscene) celebration was probably not very well received but those used to would rather whip women with dead animals than celebrate love (probably more people than you imagine).

Saint Valentine's history is the classical Christian martyr: be a nice person, do something that's illegal but shouldn't, get offer freedom in exchange for betraying your god, refuse, get killed. In the case of Valentine his "crime" was secretly marry young couples in the times when the Roman emperor his troops would fight better if he abolished marriage.

We won't argue if that was a smart move but I cannot imagine how having a wife and kids waiting for you home would not be a great motivation to be done with war fast and victorious.


## 2 Couples do what couples do 

Love moves mountains, or something like that. Love can become this powerful force that will help you go the extra mile and will give you a sense of completeness and fulfilment. But love and successful relationships don't just happen, they need to be nourished and taken care of. One of the best ways is to spend time together.

[According to many experts](https://www.redbookmag.com/love-sex/relationships/g3865/things-healthy-couples-do-together/), activities like working out or cooking together are present in most successful relationships, and could also make for an interesting and alternative plan for this Valentine's day. It is also highly recommended to celebrate together individual success for that extra feeling of team and support.

The balance between self-development and being part of something bigger than yourself could apparently be the key to a better relationship. Amongst other benefits, it's becoming increasingly clear that individual progress helps keep the "_spark_" alive in long term relationships, which gives way to many other benefits.

For example, increased levels of attraction lead to more and better sex. Frequent good sex might sound like something primitive and frivolous, but no only does it prevent most of the cheating situations, but is also linked with improved well-being in healthier couples. And, let's face it! It is a difficult topic to talk about, but is crucial to understand our behaviours, relationships and history as human animals.

## 3 Sex touches us all, and it feels so delightful

They say [internet is for porn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTJvdGcb7Fs), but that's just a reflection of humans' desire and passion towards sexuality in general (with porn being mostly a vulgar expression of it). Sex is mostly taboo, which prevents it from being seen as a normal way to intimately relate to people. Many think this fixation is a modern thing and long for past times where "_not everything was about sex_". 

This idea totally ignores the reality of previous times, where sex was as powerful of a force as it is today, maybe even more (but we'll explain why later). From the old Egyptian empire to the modern scandals in USA, all throughout history. Sexual desire has been an indissoluble part of human history. This includes homosexual disputes such as those who got [Athens' tyrant, Hipparchus, killed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmodius_and_Aristogeiton)

Even [medieval Christians would actively include and reference sex](https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/07/31/inenglish/1533051824_344537.html) in their art ([here](http://www.historia-del-arte-erotico.com/romanico_spain/home.htm) are some more graphical examples). So yeah, sex is, has been, and will most likely continue to be a big part of our history, even beyond its reproductive function. That's not a bad thing, on the contrary!

And the reason? Well apart from the pure pleasure of it, most research seems to point in the same direction: [good sex correlates with happiness](http://theconversation.com/consensual-sex-is-key-to-happiness-and-good-health-science-says-91384). Sex is a very personal thing, but whether you experience it as a very intimate and sacred act or in a more fun and hedonistic way [having good sexual life leads to a better overall life](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18576229). 

This obviously raises a lot of questions, in particular _what exactly is a "good sexual life"?_ It is hard to know what that means in practical terms... Is more better? Does it mean promiscuity, or maybe faithfulness? Is there a magic number of sexual intercourses for optimum happiness? These are difficult questions, and the answer is mostly "It depends", but let's elaborate on that.

## 4 The sex calculator what it tells you, what it doesn't 

As human animals, we tend to compulsively compare ourselves with others in almost every single aspect of our lives, so it should come as no surprise that "average sex per week" has over [254,000,000 results](https://www.google.com/search?ei=prdAXLLRGqPsrgTR4qbYCw&q=average+sex+per+week&oq=average+sex+per+week&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l10.7471.25269..25606...0.0..0.116.2703.35j2......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j0i7i30j35i39j0i20i263j0i67.e7SNzw47m94) on Google. Being sex such a hard topic to talk about in person, we have created here a tool to help you answer that question. With the help of an [online database](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s10508-017-0953-1?shared_access_token=hvifiUuXvBCKmPAnLeYDvfe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY4YL86Mm2rvz6Dvu-ljx9jRFaiNrR5COBI0x2YjUz7yjxkR5ERWsGuo-unRRQJXxL6gBaE_UdtOWUkYUCtdu5EKVkJWFvEk3zVrKAl2dxVtxND7K-i4bmb6zkceBAJeg6c=) that compiles sexual intercourse frequency in the US organized by age, race, marital status... We are able to quickly tell you how you rank against other Americans concerning the frequency of your sexual interactions.

Before we tell you how to use it we would like to make one thing very clear: normal doesn't necessarily mean good in the same way that uncommon doesn't mean bad. This tool has been made for fun and entertainment purposes, and not as a diagnostic tool for any kind of sexual problem or lack thereof. However, this tool can give you meaningless bragging rights and "fun fact" ammunition for the next time (your) sexual life becomes a topic of conversation.

We have done our best to make the calculator as easy to use and as self-explanatory as possible. However nobody is perfect and we would rather cover all of our basis, so let's see what steps one should take to make use of this fun tool:

Firstly you should input the average frequency with which you have sex. At this point, the calculator will already display a partial result comparing your frequency with that of all the Americans. But the fun doesn't have to stop here, you can keep on filling in the blanks with information about you, and the calculator will add more and more detailed comparisons for your demographic groups (men/women, age group, education...) so that you can know how you rank not only compared to any American but also amongst the ones like you.

Feel free to also try and learn something from the dataset by using different parameters, if you're a curious person. Just remember that this is no more than a fun tool to get (mostly) irrelevant information about people's lives. 

There are many more factors that play into how satisfactory or good a sexual life is other than frequency. From the obvious (and ugly) prevention of STDs and unwanted pregnancy to pleasure (which goes beyond orgasms, as we will see), intimacy or relief, there is much more about sex than pure counting and comparing who's got it bigger.

## 5 A -not so serious- note on frequency 

The frequency of sexual interactions is of very little importance. However, there are some interesting facts to talk about. For example, [studies have shown](https://www.bustle.com/p/how-much-sex-should-you-have-in-a-week-it-depends-on-your-age-new-study-finds-78455) that, statistically, couples that have sex once a week or more, on average, are happier than those who have less sex than that. However whether they have more sex because they are happier with each other or the other way around, is still a mystery. According to most experts we [should really not worry about others](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-often-you-should-be-having-sex-according-to-sex-therapists_n_57c5b96ee4b09cd22d92d358) and just focus on what works best for us and our relationship.

By now you've probably discovered already that in the USA people have sex 78.5 times per year on average. This figure varies depending on what demographic group we look at, with a general decline in frequency with age. A question that might have crossed your mind is: "_was it always like this?_" and some of you might have even tried to guess the answer.

"_Surely our parents didn't have as much sex than us, they lived other times when it was shameful and frown upon_" it's a very common thought amongst the younger generations. Surely Tinder and all the dating apps would have given us an edge... NOPE! <del>[CHUCK TESTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJP1DphOWPs)</del> 

In fact, according to the data, we are [having less sex than 20 years ago](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s10508-017-0953-1?shared_access_token=hvifiUuXvBCKmPAnLeYDvfe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY4YL86Mm2rvz6Dvu-ljx9jRFaiNrR5COBI0x2YjUz7yjxkR5ERWsGuo-unRRQJXxL6gBaE_UdtOWUkYUCtdu5EKVkJWFvEk3zVrKAl2dxVtxND7K-i4bmb6zkceBAJeg6c=)! That means that no matter what your age is, on average our parents had more sex at our age than we do. Shocking, right? The answer as to why is this happening is still unclear, and more data would be needed for a proper conclusion. 

However, there are several factors that seem very likely to have an impact such as the physical distance we're building by using (ironically) social networks on the internet as well as the higher availability of entertainment options on demand. Imagine a mildly sexual couple on a Friday evening with no plans... 20 years ago there was either something interesting on the TV or there was nothing to do. 

Right now, however, there's always a Netflix episode you can watch, a YouTube video to enjoy.... all on demand ready to prevent you from getting bored and shift your attention to your partner... Regardless of whether Netflix and chill made us less sexual, there's also the factor or knowledge and worry, especially when we mix sexual repression and bad sexual education.

## 6 With great responsibility comes great pleasure 

We have all (hopefully) heard about the risks of having sex, from [STIs](http://www.ashasexualhealth.org/stdsstis/statistics/) to unwanted pregnancy through traumatic experiences. If you haven't, please do your research, any of these things can make the best night of your life not even remotely worth it. But one thing that as a society we focus very little regarding sex: pleasure. It is undeniable that sex should be safe but sex should also be synonyms with pleasure and enjoyment.

Sex is a very personal thing and reasons to do or not anything sexual varies immensely between people, as it should. But sex should always revolve around joy, freedom, pleasure... It might sound obvious to many, but in our western society (and many others) there's a repression of sexual pleasure or a very empty and individualistic view on it.

Beyond a purely ethical or intellectual argument, there is also hard data to back up the claims for more shared pleasure in our sexual experiences. Many studies have found that regular satisfactory sex is [linked to better health](https://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/guide/sex-and-health) as well as improved physical and psychological well-being. Additionally [sex can make you look younger](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2013/07/49988/sex-make-you-look-younger) which can make you feel younger, which in turn leads to having more sex which makes you look younger... We almost have a time machine there! 

All these findings assume, naturally, satisfying and pleasurable sex. Having bad sex and experiencing frustration during or after a sexual encounter can have an adverse effect on your life. Bad experiences regarding sex are generally caused by excessive expectations, pressure, or a lack of awareness and connection during the act.


## 7 Not all sex is created equal 

Unfortunately, these feelings and attitudes are fairly common in our society due mostly to the sexual repression and shaming that co-exists with very bad sexual education. As a result, studies estimate that around 33-50% of women are dissatisfied with how often they reach orgasm and up to 15% of women do not experience one in their entire life!

It is especially shocking the shame that surrounds female pleasure because, unbeknownst to many men, women are arguably much better prepared for sexual pleasure and enjoyment. Men can have different types of orgasms, between 3 and 10 depending on how you define them, but women are capable of over 20 different orgasms (including some [surprising ones](https://helloclue.com/articles/sex/wtf-is-coregasm-how-to-have-one) according to some sources. Trying to imagine that as a guy can literally blow your mind so be careful.

What this means is that the potential (for both men and women) to enjoy sex goes not only beyond the standard in-and-out missionary intercourses but also beyond what can be seen in porn and possibly our imagination. Such ability to experience pleasure is in every one of us. It just takes practice, will and somewhere to learn from.

## (8) How to sex so that your sex is _leet_

Like with everything new that we want to learn, there are many resources from which to learn how to be better lovers and experience more and better pleasure. The Internet is a minefield full of these kinds of books, videos, courses or even just forums where people would share their experiences and tips and tricks on how to make your sexual encounters better. We know it sounds weird, but that's the most efficient way to learn anything new.

Not to leave anyone hopeless in this sea of misinformation we can recommend a couple of books  and resources for those curious

- [Come as you are](https://www.amazon.com/Come-You-Are-Surprising-Transform-ebook/dp/B00LD1ORBI) **by Emily Nagoski**: is a very highly regarded book on female sexuality with science-based information
- [Mating in captivity](https://www.amazon.com/Mating-Captivity-Unlocking-Erotic-Intelligence-ebook/dp/B000UODXP0) **by Esther Perel**: an in-depth look at what it takes to keep desire alive through everyday life
- [Sexual intelligence](https://www.amazon.com/Sexual-Intelligence-What-Really-Sex/dp/0062026070) **by Marty Klein**: a take on the importance of the mindset when having sex
- [Sexplanations](https://www.youtube.com/user/sexplanations): a YouTube channel with a funny and unrestrained yet educational take on how to have a healthy sexual life
- [Layla Martin](https://www.youtube.com/user/laylamartintv): an educational channel on conscious sexuality as well as the healing and spiritual side of sex 

But before you go and dive deep into those tools, there are certain behaviors or attitudes that can greatly help anyone willing to '1-up' their sex life. Concerning the things we should avoid we find things like desperately looking for orgasms as a measure of good sex, putting pressure on ourselves or our partner to perform good and be perfect in bed, or being judgmental with our partners.

These are the kind of attitudes that give us nothing but disappointment, fear, blockage... That is things that take away from the enjoyment and pleasure of the experience. Another very negative thing to do is, ironically, watch too much porn; especially of the hardcore, brain-numbing, over-the-top kind. Studies have shown that such behavior can easily lead to addiction, [brain damage](https://www.yourbrainonporn.com/rebooting-porn-use-faqs/does-porn-addiction-cause-irreversible-damage-to-the-brain/) or [sexual desensitization](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/porn-sex-impact-men-health-and-desensitisation-a7449311.html) at the very least.

We're clearly not condemning all porn-watching behaviors, there's a healthy way to watch porn an even include it inside a healthy sexual life without, but also with a partner. In fact, almost any sexual practice can be healthy if done the right way; which leads us to the "DOs" for a healthy sexual life. 

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:10px"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OHgYfbbCz8o" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

Everyone is different and there's not a single instruction for a fantastic sex life. However, there are certain things like communication (verbal or otherwise), respect, understanding... That are at the core of any healthy sexual life, and healthy relationship. Knowing what your partner wants and feels as well as expressing yourself in a safe and accepting environment can only improve both your sex life and your relationship.

Another important point for having better sex is to be self-aware in all aspects. This not only helps you interact better with your partner but also guide them to give you more pleasure than they could on their own. There is no shame in self-pleasuring, and it can be one of the best ways to pamper yourself and give you that much needed time of true attention and pleasure.

Integrating all of these attitudes into your sexual life will take time, and you will most likely need expert help to embrace them fully. Once you start, though, they are almost certain to improve your enjoyment of sex, the connexion with your partner(s). It will also improve your life overall, as we have discussed before.

## 9 Bang, Bang, Banging on heaven's doors 

Such is the effect that these tricks have on people's sexual life that, for many, sex become a spiritual experience beyond just the pure pleasure and intimacy. This kind of connections have been present in human history since time immemorial and have managed to survive to our times. 

Books like Kamasutra are growing again in popularity in our western culture as we slowly awake as a society to conscious pleasure. Practices like Tantric sex that were almost forgotten are slowly gaining traction thanks to more and more open attitudes to what sex should be. And having new perspectives towards sex can only be a good thing in a free society.

Of course, sex doesn't need to be spiritual to be good, and not everyone is comfortable talking about "_sex energy_" or "_Chakras_". As we said before, sex is as personal as things can get, there is nothing wrong as long as it's pleasurable for whoever is involved. But what's definitely not ideal is to keep this all in the realm of pure theory.

## 10 Now go put it all together and make this Valentine's Day the best ever

And what a better occasion to put all this together than Valentine's day? There are, clearly, many other plans to do on lover's day, but sex is as valid an option as any other, especially when paired with some nice joint activity. For some, it might be the only way to substitute chocolate without getting an angry response.

An excellent way to go about trying new things with your partner is first to talk about what they would be comfortable with. Then set the mood towards the intimate moment; a nice dinner out, some sensual music and candles when arriving home are some tried-and-tested options. Remember to let things flow, without any expectations beyond having the best time possible, together. 

So or those of you who would like to give it a go we wish you the safest, most connected and, of course, pleasurable experience with that special one. Who knows? Maybe it'll spark you up the rankings of sexual intercourse!
