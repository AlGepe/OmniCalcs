## 1 Valentine's day, celebrate the love
**==> GOAL: (let's not start directly with talking about sex?)**

As Valentine's day approaches, people start to plan how to celebrate their love or how to seize the opportunity to come out to their (hopefully) next lover. But one questions surrounds this celebration and few people have an answer to it: "_Who was Saint Valentine and why do we celebrate love oh his day?_". As with many Christian celebrations (yeah Valentine was a Christian priest), there is a distant pagan origin to it and a beautiful story about love for others and the Christian god. 

The pagan origin of this love celebration appears to be the Roman celebration of Lupercalia, a festivity around female fertility in which a dog and a goat would be sacrificed. Since apparently these sacrifices alone would not guarantee that the women would be fertile, they would then whip the women with pieces of skin from the slain animals. Moreover, such celebrations included a match making lottery in which young couples would be randomly united for at least the duration of Lupercalia, in what we could now call a crude version of the reality shows such as "First Date". But then Christianity kicked in.

Nobody expects the Spanish inquisition, but it probably came as no surprise when in 5th Century pope Gelasius I decided to incorporate the celebration of Lupercalia into the already Christian Valentine's Day so that people could still celebrate fertility like they were used to, but without any fears of 'angering God' with pagan and impure activities. This adulteration of sucha seemingly joyful (albeit obscene) celebration was probably not very well received but those used to would rather whip women with dead animals (probably more people than you imagine) but it eventually caught on. 

In all fairness to the Pope, having Valentine's Day as a "replacement" of Lupercalia was a very smart move since not only are both celebrations related conceptually (love and fertility) but they were also rightly celebrated around the 14th of February. Not only was love celebrated in Valentine's memory, but he was a martyr for defending the institution of marriage (even more linked to fertility than love). Saint Valentine went as far as to secretly marry young couples in the times when the Roman emperor had forbidden it thinking it would improve the performance of their troops in battle. We won't argue if that was a smart move but I cannot imagine how having a wife and kids waiting for you home would not be a great motivation to be done with war fast and victorious.

## 2 Couples do what couples do 
**==> GOAL: (segue from love to sex, smoothly transitioning)**

Being in love is a wonderful feeling when is corresponded; the _butterflies in the stomach_, the stupid smile that you get as a default expression in your face, the bigger appreciation of everything that's beautiful and wonderful about life... But by far the best part of being in love is when you get to spend time with your partner and share those feelings of togetherness and adoration. Valentine's day is the traditional day to be spent with your beloved one and some couples go the extra mile to make it a very special day of love and romance. We will not tell you what you should do on such a day with you loved one, but let's see some things that successful couples do and see if anything triggers a good idea for you to implement in you Valentine's day celebration.

There are obvious things that can help a relationship survive and become a very happy one, and internet is full of articles explaining them. However, as useful as it can be in the long term we don't think having the first session of couple counselling is the ideal plan for Valentine's day; you're probably better of with the true-and-tested _box of chocolates + red rose + romantic dinner_ plan that we are all familiar with. Nevertheless, we believe that there are many other activities that couples could do as a different Valentine's day plan and later even incorporate in their everyday life.

[According to many experts](https://www.redbookmag.com/love-sex/relationships/g3865/things-healthy-couples-do-together/), activities like working out or cooking together are present in most successful relationships, and could also make for an interesting and alternative plan for this Valentine's day. Research also suggest that celebrating each others individual success is related to healthier and happier relationships, so maybe you could use Valentine's day as an excuse to go the extra mile when celebrating your partner's latest achievement... 

This last suggestion seems to be quite powerful when included into one of the most powerful way to improve your relationship: evolving and improving together. Researchers have found that one of the most bonding and best ways to resurrect that initial desire in a couple is to get involved in activities that help both partners grow as a person. Be it developing a new skill, learning something interesting or perfecting some abilities, these kind of activities not only boosts confidence (and obviously capabilities) of each individual, but also enhances the desire between each other.

Researchers also show how such boost in allure and desire translates into more and better sex in the couple, which is something very important for keeping a healthy and happy relationship alive. In fact, healthy sexual relations are at the basis of pretty much every single happy couple. It is a tricky and scary subject for many, but sex and sexual interactions cannot be overlooked when we're talking about love, fertility and relationships; we could go as far as to say that sex is present in every aspect of our lives, whether it is a repressed feeling or a lascivious impulse.

**=========> Done, below just leftovers <=========**


There is plenty of information about how to have a healthy relationship, how to save a bad one or what things couples should do to stay happy together, but here at omni we won't pretend to be a couple counselling service (maybe one day we'll have a counselling calculator?). In stead, we would rather lay down the facts of what people in successful relationships do; doesn't mean that doing those things would guarantee happiness, but maybe they can spark a thought for some cool plan to do this Valentine's Day. 


1) The things couples SHOULD DO => not the best Valentine's date => maybe not that date...
1) ...however! Alternative valentine's plans anyone?
1) end with growing together kind of activities
1) growing together == better sex which is paramount and essential to most relationships.... because sex is/has been/will be the force that primitive desire that moves us humans


Growing together => more and better sex

Fight at the beginning, defined household tasks, celebrate each other's achievements, have common friends, be friends. => Happy couples do

Can do to be happy => digital disconnect, workout, be non-judgemental, New experiences, surprises/keep it fresh, SEX-STUFF

## 3 Sex touches us all, and it feels so delightful

**==> GOAL:(the universality of sex and sexual desire and it's relevance -small comment about how it relates to happiness to prepare for later sections-)**

They say [internet is for porn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTJvdGcb7Fs), but that's just a reflection of humans' desire and passion towards sexuality in general (with porn being just a very vulgar expression of it). In our society sex is still taboo, and that prevents many from seeing it as a normal way to intimately relate to people. Some would even go as far as to claim that such lustful desires are the result of a valueless society and would long for the past times where "_not everything was about sex_". 

That is not necessarily a bad point of view, except for the fact that it denies the reality of past times where sex was as powerful of a force in people's decisions as it is today, maybe even more (but we'll explain why later). From the old Egyptian empire to the modern scandals in USA, all throughout history sexual desire has been and indissoluble part of human history, including homosexual disputes like the ones that ended in the assassination of the tyrant of Athens.

It not only is undeniable that sex plays an important role in the decisions of humans (and most animals for that matter) even beyond the purely reproductive nature of it. Even [medieval Christians would actively include and reference sex](https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/07/31/inenglish/1533051824_344537.html) in their art ([here](http://www.historia-del-arte-erotico.com/romanico_spain/home.htm) are some more graphical examples). So yeah, sex is, has been, and will most likely continue to be a big part of our history. That's not a bad thing, on the contrary!

If we take a look at what science has to say about sex and sexual activities, everything seems to point in the same direction: [good sex correlates with happiness](http://theconversation.com/consensual-sex-is-key-to-happiness-and-good-health-science-says-91384). Everyone experiences sex in a different way, for some is a very intimate experience only to be shared with the one special person while for others is a pleasurable experiences that can be had whenever there's a chance for it. But in those cases (and with a big emphasis on the subjective side of _good_) [having good sexual life leads to a better overall life](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18576229).

This obviously raises a lot of questions, in particular _what exactly is a "good sexual life"?_ It is hard to know what that means in practical terms... Is more better? Does it mean promiscuity, or maybe faithfulness? How many times should one have to have a "good sexual life"? All these are hard questions to answer and are almost always best answer with "It depends on the person/circumstances" and there's not a universally correct answer.

## 4 The sex calculator what it tells you, what it doesn't 
**==> GOAL:(how to use it and the importance of its results: -spoiler- none, it's just for fun)**

As human animals we tend to compulsively compare ourselves with others in almost every single aspect of our lives, so it should come as no surprise that "average sex per week" has over [254,000,000 results](https://www.google.com/search?ei=prdAXLLRGqPsrgTR4qbYCw&q=average+sex+per+week&oq=average+sex+per+week&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l10.7471.25269..25606...0.0..0.116.2703.35j2......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j0i7i30j35i39j0i20i263j0i67.e7SNzw47m94) on Google. Being sex such a hard topic to talk about in person, we have created here a tool to help you answer that question. With the help of an [online database]() that compiles sexual intercourse frequency in the US organized by age, race, marital status... We are able to quickly tell you how you rank against other Americans in relation to the frequency of your sexual interactions.

Before we tell you how to use it we would like to make one thing very clear: normal doesn't necessarily mean good in the same way that uncommon doesn't mean bad. This tool has been made for fun and entertaining purposes, and not as a diagnostic tool for any kind of sexual problem or lack thereof. However, this tool can give you meaningless bragging rights and "fun fact" ammunition for the next time (your) sexual life becomes a topic of conversation.

We have done our best to make the calculator as easy to use and as self-explanatory as possible. However nobody is perfect and we would rather cover all of our basis, so let's see what steps one should take to make use of this fun tool:

Firstly you should input the average frequency with which you have sex. At this point the calculator will already display a partial result comparing your frequency with that of all the Americans. But the fun doesn't have to stop here, you can keep on filling in the blanks with information about you, and the calculator will add more and more detailed comparisons for your demographic groups (men/women, age group, education...) so that you can know how you rank not only compared to any American but also amongst the ones like you.

Feel free to also try and learn something from the dataset by using different parameters,if you're a curious person. Or use this calculator to learn how your friends rank thought if you ask them you're never guaranteed to get the true answer **;)**

Just remember that this is no more than a fun tool to get (mostly) irrelevant information about people's lives. There are many more factors that play into how satisfactory or good a sexual life is other than frequency. From the obvious (and ugly) prevention of STDs and unwanted pregnancy to pleasure (which goes beyond orgasms, as we will see), intimacy or relief, there is much more about sex than pure counting and comparing who's got it bigger.

## 5 A -not so serious- note on frequency 
**==> GOAL: (Data about sex intercourse declining over the las 20 years, ¿ because scary sex-ed + new tech -inet-?)**

-We have said, and we will repeat, that frequency of sexual relationships is of very little importance, however there are some interesting facts to talk about.- By now you've probably discovered already that in the USA people have sex 78.5 times per year on average. This figures varies depending on what demographic group we look at, with a general decline in frequency with age. A question that might have crossed your mind is: "_was it always like this?_" and some of you might have even tried to guess the answer.

"_Surely our parents didn't have as much sex than us, they lived other times when it was shameful and frown upon_" it's a very common thought amongst the younger generations. Surely Tinder and all the dating apps would have given us an edge... NOPE! <del>[CHUCK TESTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJP1DphOWPs)</del> In fact, according to the data, we are having less sex than 20 years ago! That means that no matter what your age is, on averages our parents had more sex at our age than we do. Shocking, right?

## 6 With a great responsibility comes a great pleasure 
**==> GOAL: (reverse take on the risks of sex; starting from sex should be safe and walking to the need for pleasurable sex and its benefits)**

We have all (hopefully) heard about the risks of having sex, from STDs to unwanted pregnancy through traumatic experiences. If you haven't please do your research, any of these things can make the best night of your life not even remotely worth it. But one thing that as a society we focus very little regarding sex: pleasure. It is undeniable that sex should be safe but sex should also be synonyms with pleasure and enjoyment.
