## 1 Valentine's day, celebrate the love
(let's not start directly with talking about sex?)

As Valentine's day approaches, people start to plan how to celebrate their love or how to seize the opportunity to come out to their (hopefully) next lover. But one questions surrounds this celebration and few people have an answer to it: "_Who was Saint Valentine and why do we celebrate love oh his day?_". As with many Christian celebrations (yeah Valentine was a Christian priest), there is a distant pagan origin to it and a beautiful story about love for others and the Christian god. 

The pagan origin of this love celebration appears to be the Roman celebration of Lupercalia, a festivity around female fertility in which a dog and a goat would be sacrificed. Since apparently these sacrifices alone would not guarantee that the women would be fertile, they would then whip the women with pieces of skin from the slain animals. Moreover, such celebrations included a match making lottery in which young couples would be randomly united for at least the duration of Lupercalia, in what we could now call a crude version of the reality shows such as "First Date". But then Christianity kicked in.

Nobody expects the Spanish inquisition, but it probably came as no surprise when in 5th Century pope Gelasius I decided to incorporate the celebration of Lupercalia into the already Christian Valentine's Day so that people could still celebrate fertility like they were used to, but without any fears of 'angering God' with pagan and impure activities. This adulteration of sucha seemingly joyful (albeit obscene) celebration was probably not very well received but those used to would rather whip women with dead animals (probably more people than you imagine) but it eventually caught on. 

In all fairness to the Pope, having Valentine's Day as a "replacement" of Lupercalia was a very smart move since not only are both celebrations related conceptually (love and fertility) but they were also rightly celebrated around the 14th of February. Not only was love celebrated in Valentine's memory, but he was a martyr for defending the institution of marriage (even more linked to fertility than love). Saint Valentine went as far as to secretly marry young couples in the times when the Roman emperor had forbidden it thinking it would improve the performance of their troops in battle. We won't argue if that was a smart move but I cannot imagine how having a wife and kids waiting for you home would not be a great motivation to be done with war fast and victorious.

## 2 Couples do what couples do 
(segue from love to sex, smoothly transitioning)

Being in love is a wonderful feeling when is corresponded; the _butterflies in the stomach_, the stupid smile that you get as a default expression in your face, the bigger appreciation of everything that's beautiful and wonderful about life... But by far the best part of being in love is when you get to spend time with your partner and share those feelings of togetherness and adoration. Valentine's day is the traditional day to be spent with your beloved one and some couples go the extra mile to make it a very special day of love and romance. We will not tell you what you should do on such a day with you loved one, but let's see some things that successful couples do and see if anything triggers a good idea for you to implement in you Valentine's day celebration.

There is plenty of information about how to have a healthy relationship, how to save a bad one or what things couples should do to stay happy together, but here at omni we won't pretend to be a couple counselling service (maybe one day we'll have a counselling calculator?). In stead, we would rather lay down the facts of what people in successful relationships do; doesn't mean that doing those things would guarantee happiness, but maybe they can spark a thought for some cool plan to do this Valentine's Day. 


1) The things couples SHOULD DO => not the best Valentine's date => maybe not that date...
1) ...however! Alternative valentine's plans anyone?
1) end with growing together kind of activities
1) growing together == better sex which is paramount and essential to most relationships.... because sex is/has been/will be the force that primitive desire that moves us humans


Growing together => more and better sex

Fight at the beginning, defined household tasks, celebrate each other's achievements, have common friends, be friends. => Happy couples do

Can do to be happy => digital disconnect, workout, be non-judgemental, New experiences, surprises/keep it fresh, SEX-STUFF
